      "text": "BENGALURU: There were no sullen faces or downcast eyes. The defeat against Australia has hurt, but Virat Kohli and his men appear to have absorbed the blow and are preparing to land one right back in their next challenge - the second Test here on Saturday. \n\nAs Australia turned out in full force for an optional training session in the afternoon, the Indian team sweated it out for over three hours at the M Chinnaswamy stadium in a marathon session that began in the morning on Wednesday. The emphasis was on close-in fielding drills and batting sessions. Understandably, there were also long inspections of the grass-laced pitch. \n\nWith Australia wrapping up the opening Test with two days to spare in Pune, the Indians had time on hand which they spent by trekking near Pune. An Indian defeat has been so rare in recent times that the loss in Pune has been a bit of a shock. But it is not the first time Kohli & Co have ended on the losing side in the opening Test - they lost the first Test against Sri Lanka in Galle in August 2015. The 63-run loss was followed by thumping wins in the next two Tests as India wrapped up the series 2-1. \n\nWhen asked if there was any similarity between the two situations, opener Murali Vijay pointed out, \"Definitely. We have to think about our game and put it in the open in the team meetings. That's what we have done in the last couple of games. Hopefully we can start with a positive frame of mind from ball one.\" \n\nThe Chennai player added that the team activity earlier this week, which included a trek, was a refreshing break for the Men in Blue. \"Team bonding activities gets you closer as a team. We have been on the road for a while now so obviously such activities help any team. We wanted to get out of the normal things we do and go out there and get some fresh air. It was fun.\" \n\nOn ironing out the rough edges in their game, especially fielding after a string of dropped catches in Pune, Vijay said: \"We had a chat about it and we are working on areas where we could do much better. We are looking forward to this game and hopefully we can pull of those catches.\" \n\nThe batsman also admitted the team gave away more runs than they expected to in the first innings. \"We gave away more than what we had expected. From there on it was always going to be tough for us to get into the game. We had the opportunities and had we grabbed those we could have put pressure on the Australians. Unfortunately it didn't and we have got to take it on the chin and move forward.\" \n\nAsked if the momentum had shifted towards Australia, Vijay replied in the negative. \"Not really. We are eager to start fresh and put the pressure back on the Australians. It is a good test of character and it is going to be a good challenge for us. That's what we are playing cricket for. Hopefully we can play the way we have to and have played before. That's going to help us.\"",

      "text": "Indian team goes trekking after loss to Australia By Rajdeep Puri | Sportskeeda – Tue 28 Feb, 2017 1:11 AM IST Picture credits: Virat Kohli ’s Facebook account What’s the story? After suffering an embarrassing defeat against Australia in the first Test of the four-match Test series at the Maharashtra Cricket Association stadium in Pune, the Indian team decided to take some time off their busy schedule to go trekking to Tamhini Ghat, which is located in Maharashtra. \nVirat Kohli , Ravindra Jadeja , and Ajinkya Rahane took to social media platform Instagram to post a picture from the team’s trek to the Ghat. In case you didn’t know... \nThe Australian cricket team humiliated India by 333 runs in the first Test after an inspired spell of bowling by Steve O’Keefe who took identical figures of 6-35 in both the innings to dismantle the Indian batting line-up. \nChasing 441 in the 2 nd innings of the match, Nathan Lyon and O’Keefe spun a web around the Indian team and bowled them out for 107. The first innings was not any better for Virat Kohli ’s side as they were bowled out for 105, in response to Australia’s 260 in their first innings. \nThe only positive for India in the match was their bowling performance with Ravichandran Ashwin , Ravindra Jadeja , and Umesh Yadav all amongst the wickets. The heart of the matter \nTamhini Ghat is located in the Western Ghat and is noted for its surroundings comprising scenic waterfalls, lakes and dense woods. An extremely popular tourist attraction for people visiting Pune, the Indian team looked to forget about the loss and have a bonding session in order to gear up for the all-important 2 nd Test against the Kangaroos. \nCaptain Virat Kohli posted a picture on his social media handle, titled –“Everyday is a blessing and an opportunity. Be grateful and keep moving ahead.” What’s next? \nThe second Test of the Border-Gavaskar series will take place at the M Chinnaswamy stadium in Bangalore on March 4 th . The final two Tests of the series will take place at Ranchi and Dharamsala respectively. Sportskeeda’s take \nAfter such a humiliating defeat, the Indian cricket team were brought back down to earth after their 19 match unbeaten streak. Such an outing was required for the team as they needed the time off to gather their thoughts and keep their mind off the field for a while. \nExtra Cover: Indian team management ordered the MCA to make a rank turner in Pune, says reports \nAfter rejuvenating themselves, they should look to bounce back strongly in the 2 nd Test at Bangalore and get back to winning ways. The plan of producing a rank turner turned out to backfire against the Indian team, hence we might see a completely different pitch in Bangalore, so it will be interesting to see how Kohli’s men go about their game against the Kangaroos. In social media... \nRavindra Jadeja and Ajinkya Rahane posted a picture of the team outing on their Instagram handles: A post shared by Ravindrasinh Jadeja (@royalnavghan) on Feb 26, 2017 at 11:52pm PST A post shared by Ajinkya Rahane (@ajinkyarahane) on Feb 26, 2017 at 11:19pm PST \n-- ",

      "text": "Johnson breaks down 1st Test 5:43 Spooky! Indian astrologer predicts dire outcome for Australia in four-Test series despite initial success February 28, 2017 6:09pm by Staff writers Source: FOX SPORTS YOU know India are getting desperate when one of their leading newspapers have turned to an astrologer — yep, that’s right, an astrologer — to critique the likelihood of Australia prevailing in the four-Test contest. \nDespite leading 1-0 in the series, the news isn’t good for Steve Smith’s men. \nIndian newspaper The Daily News and Analysis hired astrologer Greenstone Lobo to analyse the Australian players ahead of the second Test starting in Bangalore on Saturday. \nLobo started out fairly positively, saying: “Australia are a strong team astrologically. One can expect some more batsmen and pacer Jackson Bird, besides spinners Nathan Lyon and Steve O’Keefe, to excel in the three Tests ahead.” \nBut that was as far as the good news went for Smith and his troops. \n“But despite all the heroics, Australia cannot win this Test series in India,” Lobo wrote. Boof: Lyon was unlucky 0:43 \n“Astrologically, Smith is never going to be a great captain, and he definitely cannot do what even (Steve) Waugh couldn’t. It would probably have been a different equation if David Warner was leading this side. \n“Interestingly, India head coach Anil Kumble and his Australian counterpart Darren Lehmann were born in the same year and share similar planetary positions,” Lobo added. “While Lehmann has achieved all that he was destined as coach, Kumble still has more to come, which only adds to India’s chances of winning the series. \n“Virat Kohli’s horoscope is better than Smith’s and will come up the final winner,” Lobo said. \n“Expect a rejigged Indian batting line-up to fire on all cylinders and the bowling unit to rediscover its mojo from the second Test. India will bounce back dramatically and win the series.” \n*** Steve Smith celebrates his brilliant century in Pune. Source: AP \nFORGET planetary alignments, a big talking point since India’s humiliating 333-run loss has been claims that the team’s senior management hijacked the preparation of the Pune pitch. \nPune’s Maharashtra Cricket Association (MCA) Stadium made its debut as a Test venue but the state of the pitch was widely slammed, with Shane Warne saying it looked like an “eighth day wicket”. \nThe Hindustan Times reported that there was a lot of resistance to producing a raging turner of a pitch. \n“When the MCA refused to prepare a rank turner, a senior member of the team management took the issue to the state association curator Pandurang Salgaonkar. When he too resisted, the matter was placed before the BCCI curators (Daljit Singh and Dhiraj Parsana; senior members of the BCCI pitches committee), but even they were a tad reluctant,” an unnamed MCA member was quoted as saying by Indian Express in a report published on Monday. \n“Then, the BCCI management (not the Committee of Administrators, the cricket board employees) came into the picture. The ground staff had been ordered to remove the grass completely. Things were hijacked from the local curators,” the official went on to say. 'Steve's good for Australia' 1:56 \n*** \nIT looks like better news for the pitch in the second Test. Whereas Pune looked like a parched desert, the ground staff at stadium in Bangalore aren’t being miserly with water. \nThat’s according to the Indian Express , who says we’re unlikely to see a sandpit develop like in Pune. \n“You head to the stadium to see a surprising sight: water sprinkling here and there. Where Pune looked a parched desert, the ground staff at stadium in Bangalore aren’t being miserly with water. Not yet. The word is that the pitch would be a slow turner — something that would help spin from second or third day but it won’t be a sand pit. A usual Bangalore track, in other words.” \n*** \nBUT the state of the pitch is causing headaches among former players, notably India spin legend Erapalli Prasanna, who told The Hindustan Times that: “If I was the curator, I would prepare a good wicket, which will turn from fourth and fifth day.” 'He bowled to his strengths' 1:22 \n“For Bangalore, we are caught between the devil and the deep sea,” Prasanna declared on Monday, observing that the Indian team management will be in a dilemma over the wicket for the second Test after their ploy to go for a rank turner in the first game spectacularly backfired. \n“I don’t expect a turner at Bangalore,” the former off-spinner predicted ahead of the match to be staged in his hometown from Saturday. \n*** \nFURTHER confusing matters about the expected state of the Banglaore pitch is that it has in the past provided plenty of initial assistance to fast bowlers before becoming a batsman’s dream. \nwwww.mid-day.com recounted how the local state team have almost always bowled first. \n“To make it more intriguing, this is one venue where teams winning the toss have chosen to bowl first, something which is almost unheard of in India, The local state team, Karnataka, with a good crop of pacers in their midst, have almost always bowled first for the pitch is known to have something in it for the bowlers on day one and thereafter it becomes a batsman’s dream. Even Virat Kohli invited the South Africans to bat first in the last Test played here in November 2015 but then it wasn’t his pacers but spin twins R Ashwin and R Jadeja who bagged four each, to bowl out the visitors for 214 on Day One.” Monty heaps praise on O'Keefe 4:59",

      "text": "More than a million traders in India are boycotting fizzy drinks including Coca-Cola and Pepsi after claims from from two Indian trade associations that foreign firms are exploiting the country’s water resources.\nTraders in the south Indian state of Tamil Nadu, which has a population bigger than the UK, will replace big brands with locally produced soft drinks. \n“These foreign companies are using up scarce water resources of the state,” said K Mohan , secretary of the Vanigar Sangam, one of the associations supporting the boycott. \nConcerns about excessive water usage by companies such as Coca-Cola and PepsiCo were heightened after low rainfall during the last monsoon. \nIn January, Tamil Nadu’s interim chief minister O Panneerselvam declared the state “drought-hit” and asked the central government for funds to help farmers.\nVikram Raja, president of the Vanigar Sangam trade association, said: “[Foreign companies] are exploiting the state’s water bodies to manufacture aerated drinks while farmers were facing severe drought.”\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest A 2016 protest in Bangalore about the diversion of water to drought-hit Tamil Nadu. Photograph: Jagadeesh Nv/EPA \nAmit Srivastava, who works at NGO India Resource Centre, estimates that it takes 1.9 litres of water to make one bottle of Coca-Cola. He says demand for sugar from fizzy drinks companies is also hugely problematic in India. “Sugarcane is a water-guzzling crop. It is the wrong crop for India ,” he said.\n“According to our research Coca-Cola is the number one buyer of sugarcane in India and Pepsi is number three. If you take into account the water used for sugarcane, then we’re using 400 litres of water to make a bottle of Cola.”\nSpeaking to the BBC’s Tamil service, the Indian Beverage Association (IBA), which represents many soft drinks manufacturers, said it was disappointed with the boycott.\n“Coca-Cola and PepsiCo India together provide direct employment to 2,000 families in Tamil Nadu and more than 5,000 families indirectly … IBA hopes that good sense will prevail and that consumers will continue to have the right to exercise their choice in Tamil Nadu,” it said.\n\nCity of burning lakes: experts fear Bangalore will be uninhabitable by 2025 Read more \nPepsi and Coca-Cola have not directly commented on the ban.\nThe anti-fizzy drinks movement in Tamil Nadu gathered momentum in January, during protests against the supreme court’s decision to ban jallikattu , an Indian version of bullfighting. \nThe protests offered many citizens to air their grievances publicly, and galvanised the fizzy drinks boycotts after farmers complained big companies were using up precious resources in the water-stressed state. \nRaja says demand for fizzy drinks has dropped significantly since January, and many traders who are not part of the trade association have voluntarily stopped stocking foreign brands. \n\nThe boycotts may only be the beginning of Coca-Cola and PepsiCo’s woes as they try to expand in India. The Indian government has dropped hints that it may introduce a “sin tax” on sugary drinks, which could further hit growth figures. \n“It is extremely unfair on the part of certain individuals and organisations to propagate misinformation,” said Arvind Varma, secretary general of the IBA. “These actions are detrimental to the image of the country and to the long-term interests of the Indian economy,” he said.",

      "text": "Johnson breaks down 1st Test 5:43 India take screwdrivers to Bangalore pitch for second Test after Pune minefield blew up in their faces March 1, 2017 6:58pm by Ben Horne Source: The Daily Telegraph AUSTRALIA is bracing for a war of attrition in Bangalore after paranoid curators used screwdrivers, hessian bags, hoses and a mystery substance to try and take Mitchell Starc and Steve O’Keefe out of the second Test. \nEmbarrassed after the debacle in Pune, the BCCI appear hell bent on using any means necessary to manufacture conditions that will set up a brutal five-day battle in the hope it will favour the innate skills and home ground knowledge of the embattled Indians. \nIn contrast to the crumbly, dust bowl that disintegrated on the spot and played into Australia’s hands in the first Test, the Bangalore centre square looked more like a green monster, but not one that will offer bounce and carry. Instead, a surface purposefully designed to try and silence reverse swing masters Starc and Josh Hazlewood. The pitch at Bangalore during the calm before the second Test storm. Source: Supplied \nIndia’s plan is to pile on a mammoth first innings total and then slowly grind their opponents into the dirt, meaning Australia’s top order must go large and be the ones to pave the way to victory. \nCurators resorted to cloak and dagger methods on Wednesday, driving a screwdriver into the middle of the pitch and using a mystery substance to try and close up cracks, before hastily covering the wicket up to conceal it from view. \nHowever, before the pitch went under covers, some noticeable bare patches were revealed, including one ominous spot outside off-stump to the left-hander, which appears custom made for Indian spinner Ravi Ashwin. \nMiraculously for India, curators found a couple of hoses and watered the wicket and centre square generously in a bid to help it retain its moisture. \nThe wicket is dry, but it will hold together for the long haul — explanation of why there’s been nine draws in Bangalore from 21 Tests. \nStarc was expecting an abrasive centre square lined with used wickets to offer extra help to make the ball reverse, but instead the middle was strikingly lush and green, meaning Australia will have to work extra hard to move the ball off the straight. \n“There is probably going to be a couple of wickets on the square when the ball gets into that off the bat it’s going to create some rough sides on the ball,” Starc had said on Tuesday. \n“That’s going to create some rough sides on the ball so it’s about looking after that shiny side for us. \n“If it’s not going to spin as much in Bangalore, we’re going to have to make sure we’re using that reverse swing.” \nIn the past year, Bangalore has dug up its entire outfield and replaced it, making for a pristine outfield as green as Australia would ever see in India. Australia's spin guru 0:38 \nAustralian captain Steve Smith felt the Pune minefield brought O’Keefe and Nathan Lyon right into the match because of the extreme turn created. \nHowever, on a pitch that won’t spin that much, O’Keefe and Lyon will have to work harder for their wickets, and there’s a feeling from India that over the course of five days a tradesman like Ashwin will prevail. \nBatting appears key. \n“It could be a similar wicket to the England series (against India) where we saw big first innings totals with 500 plus,” said Starc. \n“It’s going to be important for our batters to make the most out of our first innings. \n“We know the first innings are going to be huge now for the rest of the series.” View All Comments The latest sports news, in your inbox daily.

      "text": "Cricket Rohit Sharma leads epic mannequin challenge at NCA Rohit Sharma, Dhawal Kulkarni, Amit Mishra and Mohammed Shami pose as they train at the National Cricket Academy News 28 Feb 2017, 17:45 IST Rohit Sharma was last spotted having fun in Germany as he recovers from injury What’s the story? \nInjured Indian cricket team batsman Rohit Sharma led an intriguing version of the viral mannequin challenge featuring Indian cricketers Dhawal Kulkarni, Amit Mishra, Mohammed Shami and a local helper at the National Cricket Academy in Bangalore. \nThe result was an absolute knockout rendition of the challenge. \nExtra cover: Rohit Sharma and KL Rahul have fun in Germany The context \nThe mannequin challenge is a video when people stay stationary while a camera moves around them to capture their expressions. It is widely believed that the origin of this dates back to a group of students in Jacksonville, Florida who posted a video in October, 2016. \nThe video proved to be extremely popular and spread like wildfire with a number of sports teams including the Portugal national football team and the Cleveland Cavaliers producing their own version of the same. \nRohit Sharma and the other cricketers who are on the comeback trail featured in the video and showed that they aren’t losing heart as they look to get back in top shape. The details \nThe mannequin challenge was popularized in India when Indian and English commentators got together in November to produce an epic version of the challenge. \nWhile replicated in houses across the country, many fans were left wondering as to what a mannequin challenge of the Indian cricket team might look like. The fans were obliged when the team posted one after their emphatic series win over England. Parallels from history \nSports teams across the globe delighted fans with their version of the mannequin challenge. Our personal favourite is the one that features the Portuguese football team, led by none other than Cristiano Ronaldo. Sportskeeda’s take \nRohit Sharma and his gang are undoubtedly slightly late to get on the mannequin challenge train as the trend has since died down. However, we are pleased to add that they produced one of the best versions of the video that we have seen yet. \nEach cricketer is involved with his own activity while the presence of one of the helpers at the NCA, who is serving a cup of tea to Dhawal Kulkarni lends a very human touch to the video. \nMohammed Shami is being tended to and Indian fans will be hoping that he makes his comeback soon but surely just the sight of Rohit Sharma looking sharp will leave the fans delighted.

This announcement comes days after Reliance Jio claimed to have reached 100 million users in only 170 days owing to its cheap data and call charges. \nAccording to a statement released by the telecom network, going forward, incoming calls and text messages will be free. Starting from April 1, 2017, no premium will be charged on outgoing calls and additional data charges will be dropped on national roaming. The report further clarifies that if a data pack is activated on its home network, it will remain activated even while on roaming. In the case of international roaming, to avoid any “bill shocks” for postpaid customers, their data pack will be adjusted to an equivalent data pack in that country. \nWhen on international roaming, call charges will be reduced to Rs 2 per minute and while data charges might go up to Rs 3 per megabyte when at “popular roaming destinations,” they will be levied only when an international roaming pack is exhausted. Also read: After 100M users, Ambani woos Reliance Jio users with ‘Jio Prime Membership’ \nAt the recently held Mobile World Congress in Barcelona, addressing over 300 companies, Sunil Mittal, Chairman of Bharti Airtel and GSM Association said, \nAs an industry, operators across the world must collaborate to remove the cost barrier to roaming and offer customers the convenience of staying connected without the fear of exorbitant bill charges. \nHe further added, \nI am declaring a war on roaming. We have a global network, but very few people are allowed to enjoy it. It (exorbitant fees) is a disaster our industry has created. \nThe 17-18 countries Airtel operates in will allow its customers to have the freedom to switch on their mobile phones \"wherever and whenever they want.\" Sunil Bharti Mittal \nHe said, \nIt is my estimated guess that 90 percent of travellers from emerging markets switch off their mobile data. They go for local SIM cards, they go for the nearest Wi-Fi spot, they wait for themselves to get to their hotel. What have we done to our industry? This must stop. \nThe industry needs to address this as well as the disdain its customers have for operators, he said. \n\"I can promise you that during my term at GMSA, roaming charges and bill shocks will be a thing of the past. I promise you that ,\" said Mittal, who is also the chairman of the GSMA, the trade body for the mobile industry. \nAirtel is not the only one making big changes — Vodafone had also dropped its rates considering the big splash the Ambani product had made. As of now, an Idea Cellular customer is the only one being charged for his/her incoming calls while on roaming. \nCalling all Bangalore startups!

(PSL) \nHours after Quetta Gladiators secured a spot in the 2017 Pakistan Super League (PSL) final, foreign players Kevin Pietersen, Tymal Mills and Luke Wright confirmed they would not partake in the final via Twitter. \nQuetta Gladiators beat Peshawar Zalmi by one run in a thrilling Qualifier 1 match to reach their second successive PSL final. \nHowever, the Pakistan Cricket Board’s (PCB) decision to host the final in Lahore, rather than the United Arab Emirates where the rest of the tournament took place, has not gone down well with international players in the tournament. Lahore was the site of terrorist attacks and bomb blasts in recent weeks. \nConcerned with the security arrangements, Pietersen, Mills and Wright took to Twitter to announce that they would not be travelling to Lahore for the final. \nPietersen played an important part in Quetta’s campaign, including scoring 40 runs from 22 balls in against Peshawar to take his season tally to 241 runs. \nHe tweeted soon after the match that he was leaving Dubai to return home to London. I'll pick that up in London tomorrow. Bye bye Dubai! Your weather was 👎🏼 but the golf was 👍🏻. #FamilyTime https://t.co/jMIMrL26NY — KP (@KP24) February 28, 2017 \nHe tweeted again after reaching London on Wednesday. The journey from Heathrow to my house to see my babies is the just the best! Long winter schedule done! Time to chill! Ciao x — KP (@KP24) March 1, 2017 \nMills tweeted his gratitude to Quetta Gladiators and the league after the team reached the final but said with regret that he would be watching the match from home. \nThe T20 specialist — who was the second most expensive player at the 2017 Indian Premier League auction, being picked up by Royal Challengers Bangalore for Rs 12 crore — had taken seven wickets from five matches for Quetta. — Tymal Mills (@tmills15) February 28, 2017 \nEngland allrounder Wright only played one match in PSL 2017 but put up an emotional message explaining his decision to opt out of the final. \n“It’s with a heavy heart I will not be coming to Lahore. I have a young family and for me a game of cricket is just not worth the risk. I’m sorry as I know how much it means to you all and hopefully in the future the safety will not be in doubt to come play there. Thanks once again to @TeamQuetta and @thePSLt20 for having me. Such lovely people. Great tournament with so much talent. See u soon, (sic)” Wright tweeted. It's with a heavy heart I will not be coming to Lahore.

Such lovely people. Great tournament with so much talent. See u soon 👍👍 3/3 — Luke Wright (@lukewright204) February 28, 2017 \nNathan McCullum hasn’t featured for the team this season but confirmed previously that he wouldn’t partake in the final in Lahore. \nHe uploaded a video of the team celebrating progression to the final on his Twitter account. The @TeamQuetta lads know how to celebrate.Great victory tonight and fantastic group of guys. Another final for us. #pslfinal #KaiKaiQuetta pic.twitter.com/CCq4hMYnN7 — Nathan McCullum (@MccullumNathan) February 28, 2017 \nSouth African batter Rilee Rossouw, the team’s leading run-getter with 255 runs, is yet to announce whether he will play the final scheduled for March 5 in Lahore’s Gaddafi Stadium. \nForeign internationals had been offered one-off payments ranging from USD 10,000 to USD 50,000 to play the final. tags ",

But the change would come just a few years after the Lightning Port was introduced with the iPhone 5.

GAME Digital \nWhen Apple moved from its much larger old connector to the new one, with that phone, it provoked a huge range of complaints. It meant that everyone's charging cables could no longer be used, as well as stopping accessories like charging docks and speakers from connecting to the new phones. iPhone 8 wireless charging likely to come with new phone \nLightning was presented at the time as being far smaller, and so allowing for the phones to shrink. It also allows considerably more data to be transferred and is reversable – both of which are also characteristics of USB-C. \nThe change to USB-C has been speculated on, but no reliable rumour has previously suggested it. But the new report from the usually reliable WSJ has provoked worry about the change among iPhone fans. \nThe introduction would be the first time that Apple hasn't used its own connector to charge phones. It would also be the second controversial change in a port in as many years – following only a year after Apple dropped the headphone jack from the iPhone 7, and encouraged people to use wireless headphones or ones that plug into the Lightning port instead. \nThe iPhone 8 might also be the first to introduce wireless charging and so go around using the port entirely, according to separate leaks. \nThe new phone will also feature a curved display and a special camera in the front that can sense depth, according to the same WSJ report. Both of those rumours square with previous reporting. \nApple is expected to introduce three new phones – an iPhone 7s and 7s Plus, alongside the more innovative iPhone 8 – in the autumn.

      "text": "Bumpadum founder Anuradha Rao.\nJust how much pee and poop a cute little baby can unleash is unbelievable. I discovered it the hard way.\nI’d sworn to use cloth nappies with my firstborn, as I absolutely wasn’t going to throw six diapers a day into the dustbin and look the other way while they took 500 years to decompose . Plus those thick, mountainous layers could leave a bad skin rash in the tropical heat of Delhi.\nBut trying to be eco-friendly almost took my sanity away.\nI was cleaning her, changing the soiled bed linen, washing nappies (made of plain cotton cloth), and never getting more than two hours of sleep at a stretch because the little one would start crying at the slightest hint of wetness.\nNaturally, when my second kid was born four years ago, I took to disposable diapers like bees to honey.\nNobody had told me about “cloth diapers” then. Yes, things that combine the convenience of a diaper with the environment-friendliness of cloth do exist, but apparently no one thought of making it in a country that has forever tied cloth around the loins of its babies.\nNo one until Anuradha Rao, that is.\nBattling a dilemma similar to mine, the former IBM executive decided to do something about it. A year ago, she founded Bumpadum , a small startup in Bangalore that makes and supplies adorable printed cloth diapers for children online.\n“We are the only cloth diaper company that manufactures in India, though there are a few brands that import from China and sell here,” says Anuradha, mother to a two-and-a-half-year-old girl.\nHer firm has sold 1,200 of them since July last year and claims to be growing 20 percent month-on-month. “If you exclude my salary, we are a profitable business,” Anuradha tells Tech in Asia . The startup sells with the help of social media – Amazon, Instagram, and Facebook, besides its own website.\nEach Bumpadum diaper costs around US$14.9. But here’s why shelling out that amount on a single diaper isn’t as crazy as it sounds.\nThe conscientious parent From the age of 0 to 3, a baby goes through 7,000 diapers on an average. So imagine the load a single diaper-clad baby can put on the earth.\nThe statistics began to weigh heavily on Anuradha. “I was using disposable diapers for my daughter since her birth in 2014. But the quantity of waste generated hit me as she neared a year.”\nShe was part of a Facebook group called Cloth Diapering India, but realized that member moms were using imported cloth diapers – either expensive ones from the US or cheaper ones from China.\nWhat do you think she did? Quit her job as managing strategy consultant at IBM and started Bumpadum.\nPhoto credit: Bumpadum.\n“I had lived in the US earlier, and my husband and I were wondering whether to move back there again after the baby. But I always wanted to do something of my own. We decided to stay put once Bumpadum happened.”\nJust as well, because people forget how important it is for mothers to get sound sleep. And a good diaper can really make that happen.\nPampers and Huggies are some of the popular brands in India. But Anuradha says disposable diapers “have been able to penetrate just 2 percent of the market.”\nCloth diapers are also lighter on your wallet, she says. “You will shell out up to US$1,124 on disposable diaper packs for a baby till the age of 3, whereas if you use ours, you spend around US$375 on 25 diapers in all.”\nDo cloth diapers really work? The special padding inside does the trick, but it requires some prepping – the more it is washed, the better the absorption.\n“We use micro-fleece and hemp in the padding,” says Anuradha. “Micro-fleece absorbs moisture immediately,” she explains, “but since the quality available in India is not good, we import it from China.” The other important raw material is cotton, which is sourced from India itself.\nThe diapers come with inserts (extra padding) for additional protection. So you can step out with a baby for three hours in the day or make her wear it for about seven hours at night.\n“There’s flexibility with the inserts. You can put in more if your baby pees more than others,” she says.\nA tailor stitches a Bumpadum cloth diaper. Photo credit: Bumpadum.\nHere’s another thoughtful feature. Since one size doesn’t fit all, these diapers are adjustable. You can increase or decrease the size around the waist and thighs with the help of buttons stitched onto it.\n“We expect each to last about 100 washes,” she says. Not having to discard them, I think, is the whole point.\nPoopy business Now for the crux of the matter – laundry! That is the single biggest reason for parents to move to disposable diapers. But Bumpadum says soiled cloth diapers need only be stored in a dry bucket, and can be washed at convenience in a washing machine.\nThe real challenge, though, is poop The real challenge, though, is poop.\nAnuradha admits it is “the only con.” You have to knock the solids off completely before you can throw a diaper into a washing machine. But it can be done. If you manage to gain entry to their Facebook page, you will find that many moms are doing it already.\nThis page, a closed but steadily growing group, has over 1,200 members – and some moms put up the most adorable pictures of babies in Bumpadum diapers that complement the outfit.\nPhoto credit: Bumpadum.\n“We recently got into the Amazon Launchpad , which helps us get a prominent product display, marketing help, and reach out to global customers.”\nAnuradha is hesitant about selling her diapers at a physical store. “It is a niche product that needs explaining,” she replies. “Customers in India might see it in a store and say ‘Rs.1,000 for a diaper – are you out of your mind!’”\nCloth diapers imported from the US cost around US$23.90, while those from China are around US$7.49 to US$12, she says. Bumpadum will cost somewhere in between. “We will probably be able to reduce the price as we scale.”\nAnd this startup doesn’t just do diapers.\nI zeroed in on two cheerful-looking ‘wet bags’, which were meant to carry soiled diapers but could tuck in wet swimming costumes as well. By the time I got down to ordering them a day later, one design was already out of stock.\n“We stock around 200 items at a time, and add stock every week,” says Anuradha.\nFor her, there’s another, tougher, task on hand. “Managing Bumpadum with my daughter is the biggest challenge. I put my phone on silent mode when I’m with her, and get on with it!”\nConverted from Indian Rupees. Rate: US$1 = INR 66.73. \nThis post She quit her IBM job to found a diaper company appeared first on Tech in Asia.\n",

      "text": "Eden Test 2001 (Reuters Photo) Highlights 1 India had lost the first Test of the series in Mumbai by 10 wickets back in 2001 2 India made a remarkable comeback to beat Australia by 171 runs in the second Test at Eden Gardens and also won the series 2-1 3 Kohli's men lost the Pune Test by 333 runs and the next Test starts on March 4 in Bengaluru \nOn what India did differently in 2001 and what they should do differently in 2017 \nSourav Ganguly: Even it (the defeat to Australia in the Mumbai Test) happened in the Western part of India. Australia surprised me to be honest. When you look at that Australian side of 2001, they had every ammunition in the armoury to beat a side anywhere in the world. You look at the spin department, you look at the batting department. \nI still remember the innings Adam Gilchrist played in Mumbai. That was the best knock I have seen on a tuning pitch. It turned, it bounced and he smashed everything. But Australia's performance was terrific in Pune. To get India out twice for 105 and 107 was a munumental effort. But I actually still believe deep inside that India will win this series. \nOn whether India had bad luck back then (Reuters Photo) \nSourav Ganguly: Yeah, we were cursed actually, I remember. Questions were raised. Even I was worried because they were a terrific side. When you compare these two sides, I remember India played poorly and I believe that it was a one-off Test match in Pune and the team will come back hard. \nWe were a young side back then. There was no Anil Kumble, no Javagal Srinath. Harbhajan Singh making a comeback after 4 or 5 years. The question I had to ask then was: Did we have the team to beat them? \nSo, I came to Kolkata and prepared for the Test match. The first question in my mind was: Do I have the bowling to take 20 wickets? We played three Test matches in the series. Harbhajan was constant at one end and we had three different spinners. Rahul Sanghvi bowled in Mumbai, Venkatapahy Raju bowled here (in Kolkata) and then Nilesh Kulkarni went and bowled in Chennai. \nSo, it was different in Chennai. The Test match at Eden Gardens I feel was a freak. India have come back in the recent past in Sri Lanka in Galle when they were 1-0 down even though, Sri Lanka was a very good team. \nBack then, VVS Laxman was not the same. Except Sachin Tendulkar and probably me. Captain and the seniormost pro. This team was still finding its ground. We had young openers Shiv Sunder Das and I can't remember who was opening at the other end. That is what it is and I remember on the second evening when I was going back to the hotel, I knew the series was gone. We were 190 all out, Australia got 400. We did not have an answer to the Australian way of playing the game but then Laxman and Rahul Dravid (turned it around). I had a partnership with VVS - 130 odd runs for the 5th wicket and then Dravid and VVS put on a momumental effort. \nSo, as I said, it was a freak. \nOn his strategy after the Mumbai defeat \nSourav Ganguly: I didn't have a strategy because we had lost the first Test, we had lost the first two days of the (second) Test match and there was no strategy and the only thing we did was that we kept pushing those guys for one more session and then another session. \nOn his memories from the Eden Gardens Test (Reuters Photo) \nSourav Ganguly: I still remember the fourth evening, we had to put saline on Dravid and VVS. There were 2 physio tables and both of them were on the tables, getting some water into the body. They got dehydrated batting in the month of March. I believe that was the luck - Sourav Ganguly luck and then Harbhajan spun it. \nAnd on the fifth day, just before tea, Australia were three down. I remember dropping a catch of Steve Waugh at leg slip off Harbhajan and as he walked past he said, \"I don't think you are going to win the Test match\". And when he came back after tea, he flicked the ball and he got caught off the back foot at short-leg. We got seven wickets in that session. \nIt was desiny and once I went past that Test match, we knew that we will beat them in Chennai. \nEven though India have lost the first Test match, they will come back and beat them in Bangalore. \nOn Virat Kohli's attitude after a heavy defeat: \nSourav Ganguly: I loved the press conference Virat did after the match. He was not trying to hide anything. It was just that we didn't bat well and that is why we lost the Test match. At the same time, he said it is one-off and I believe the same. India has been brilliant in the last 10 months, winning almost everything but they will have to come back and play hard. \nVirat Kohli has terrific leadership skills. I have a lot of faith in his leadership. He is honest which is very important and his message to his team is very clear. I saw his pictures in the newspapers and saw that he was off to a cliff for a break and it is a great thing. He won't keep winning forever. \nYou lose at home as well and many teams have lost. It was not the first time and you just need to get it out of the system, take a break and come back in Bangalore. And when you prepare such pitches as the one in Pune and I know the curator was not happy, then you give average bowlers a chance and I am not belittling Steven O'Keefe. \nBut he becomes a wicket-taker which he won' be normally on a batting pitch. India need to prepare good pitches, take the Test match to day four an then take the game forward. \nIn Mumbai and Chennai, England scored 400-450 in the 1st innings and India scored over 600 and they came back and won. So, they have done good things. They have the bowling that can win Test matches. \nOn his plans to contain a dangerous Australia in 2001: \nI had a simple strategy and I knew I was up against a very good Australian side. I knew runs were important. I just attacked with Harbhajan and defended with the others. If I had Anil Kumble at the other end, then I would have attacked with two spinners. But Virat has two spinners - R Ashwin and Ravindra Jadeja are both very good spinners. India don't need to worry. A Four-Test series is a long series. Even against England, they were under pressure in Rajkot and Virat had to bat to save the Test match and they were a different side. But drawing and winning is different. Australia will come back very confident because they have won a Test. \nAnd they have also started believing that they can beat this side also because of the way they batted. Steven Smith's hundred , I believe one, was one of the best on turning tracks. I have seen Gilchist and I then saw Michael Clarke get a century. \nOn Virat Kohli's rare failure Reuters Photo \nSourav Ganguly: Kohli is human and he had to fail one day. He failed in both innings in Pune. I think he played a little bit of a loose shot in the first innings outside the off stump but the Australians bowled him there. They must have seen Stuart Broad and James Anderson bowling to him in England outside the off stump. In the second innings, I think the game was already over. A 441-run target was a humongous task. Kohli will come back because he is a class act. His record against Australia is unreal. To watch those four back-to-back Test match hundreds against Australia in Australia (was surreal). I have not seen even Sachin Tendulkar do that. Getting four Test match hundreds in every venue on your second trip to Australia is a special special effort. \nOn India's spinners \nSourav Ganguly: I think Ashwin and Jadeja will do it. Umesh Yadav bowled superbly. The best I have seen him bowl in Test match. India won a Test match at Lord's and England went on to win the series 3-1 in 2014. They have the team and it is the belief. India will have to believe. India needs to use the DRS better. \nOn the Kumble-Kohli combination \nSourav Ganguly: Anil will have to work with Virat and I am sure they will work together. It is not the end of the world. It is pressure but you will not lose everytime. India lost the 1st T20 against England and looked down and out in the 2nd but Jasprit Bumrah bowled the magical over and India won the match and went on to win the series from there. They will have to go back to the basics get the thought process and I hope Anil Kumble will support them. \nOn Jayant Yadav's place in the team \nSourav Ganguly: May be I could leave Jayant Yadav out and play extra batsman give Karun Nair a chance. Ajinkya Rahane is looking a little down in confidence. You just need 4 bowlers in India. Two spinners will give you 20 wickets in Test matches. Bowlers will have to bowl long spells Ashwin and Jadeja are capable o For more news from India Today, follow us on Twitter @indiatoday and on Facebook at facebook.com/IndiaToday For news and videos in Hindi, go to AajTak.in . ताज़ातरीन ख़बरों और वीडियो के लिए आजतक.इन पर आएं.

      "text": "India vs Australia series: After Test, high-pitch battle India vs Australia series: After Test, high-pitch battle Match referee rates Pune pitch ‘poor’; former MCA boss Ajay Shirke demands an inquiry into the fiasco. Published:March 1, 2017 1:29 am In Pune’s first-ever Test match, Australia defeated India by 333 runs in two-and-a-half days. Reuters \nThe Maharashtra Cricket Association (MCA), which hosted the first Test between India and Australia in Pune, is not worried about match referee Chris Broad’s assessment of the pitch. Broad rated the deck as “poor” and the world body, in turn, has asked for an explanation from the BCCI. Pune hosted its first-ever Test from February 23, which India lost inside three days by 333 runs. \nPossible ICC sanction might follow, but MCA president Abhay Apte sounded very confident. “I don’t see that happening, frankly speaking, because of the reason that I have with me. As far as today’s issue is concerned, the BCCI hasn’t forwarded anything to us or called for our explanation. If that is asked, we will definitely give details to them. I’m awaiting a communication from the BCCI. (And) We will give an adequate reply,” Apte told The Indian Express. Watch What Else Is Making News \nAsked what is adequate, he said: “Adequate is substantiated by something. Otherwise it would be inadequate. We believe in fairness and believe that fairness will prevail. We feel we did no wrong.” \nThe ICC release said: “Broad, in accordance with Clause 3 of the ICC Pitch and Outfield Monitoring Process, submitted his report to the ICC in which he expressed concern over the quality of the pitch.” \nFormer MCA president Ajay Shirke described the whole matter as “pitch-fixing”, while demanding a CBI inquiry to unravel the truth. \n“The entire cricket board went through a major upheaval in the name of transparency and accountability…The Maharashtra Cricket Association Stadium pitch has always been seamer-friendly. If you check the Ranji Trophy record (at this venue), it will be evident. Just three-four weeks ago, over 700 runs had been scored in an ODI (between India and England). Now suddenly what happened to the very same curator! Did he go mad? Did he lose his sense? Was he intoxicated? What happened? \n“Let us get to the bottom of pitch-fixing in this era of transparency and accountability. Let there be a CBI inquiry and find out who spoke to whom. Too many people have operated under cover of darkness for too long. This is a no-win situation for the poor association that it is being made the villain, while the real villains are hiding somewhere else,” Shirke launched a broadside. \nThis paper has already reported, quoting an MCA member, how “things were hijacked from the local curators” as the Indian team management insisted on having a rank turner. This was despite MCA chief curator Pandurang Salgaoncar explaining to them as well as BCCI curators and employees that the Pune pitch, made of mixed soil, required a little bit of grass and some moisture to last the distance. \nThe match referee had earlier sent an internal note to the ICC that practice pitches and the match wicket differed in nature. The state association has kept an internal record of the whole sequence in writing and it is learnt that it will be forwarded if an explanation is sought. \nAs per the ICC pitch and outfield monitoring process, a pitch is described as “poor” if it offers excessive seam movement, and/or displays excessive unevenness/inconsistency of bounce and/or offers excessive turn from the beginning and/or is completely deadpan. \nTwo seasons ago, the Nagpur pitch was given a “poor” rating by Jeff Crowe, who was the match referee for the third Test between India and South Africa. The match, played from November 25, 2015 also finished inside three days, with India winning by 124 runs. Spinners bagged 33 wickets in that Test. In Pune, India and Australia tweakers collectively accounted for 31 scalps. \nThe Nagpur pitch got away with an “official warning” after its first offence. Pune, too, faces the possibility of a warning and/or pecuniary penalty not exceeding $15,000. \nThe ICC chief executives committee meeting in the first week of February decided to crack the whip on substandard pitches by introducing demerit points. “It was agreed that a system of Demerit Points be introduced, similar to the new Code of Conduct System, as per the table below. Demerit points will remain active for a rolling five-year period. When a venue accumulates 5 Demerit Points, its ICC accreditation will be suspended for a period of 12 months. Should a venue reach 10 points, its accreditation will be suspended for 24 months,” the release said. Three demerit points for a “poor” pitch has been agreed upon. For “below average” and “unfit” pitches, demerit points are two and five respectively. Pune’s Test journey could begin with a serious handicap. \nStarc expects another dry wicket \nReuters adds from Bangalore: Australia paceman Mitchell Starc reckoned he and Josh Hazlewood would have to shoulder more responsibility in the match starting on Saturday. “I’m sure it will be a pretty dry wicket again, so that’ll probably help reverse swing there and it’s something we’ll be working hard at all the time in the nets,” said the 27-year-old.

      "text": "Stories Startup 5-star quality at roadside prices — how Tpot aims to take its tea retail chain to Rs 100cr in 3 years Flipboard \nTpot runs 25 tea retail outlets in Delhi-NCR and plans to expand to other parts of the country soon \nIn India, chai is not a simple beverage, it’s an obsession. Our breakfast isn’t complete without tea. It’s the first thing (of course, after water) you serve to guests. You meet people or clients over tea. It’s also used as a medicinal drink — we commonly use adrak chai for cold, tulsi chai for respiratory illness and green tea for acid reflux, to name a few. L-R: Atit verma, Robin Jha and Asad Khan \nThere are various stories on how Indians became so obsessed with this drink within a century of its introduction in the country by the British. India consumes 837,000 tonnes of tea every year, making it the most popular drink by far. \nFour years ago, this market size drew the attention of Robin Jha, Asad Khan and Atit Kumar, three friends, when they decided to dive into the pool of entrepreneurship. A market just waiting to be tapped \nRobin, a chartered accountant, was then working with E&Y, and was part of the transaction advisory team. During his stint with the company, he interacted with many startups and became inspired by their visions. \nWhen Robin decided to launch a startup himself, he saw no better opportunity than the tea market. He discussed the idea with his two friends, who also wanted to start their own business, and they agreed to come onboard. \nIn 2013, with an initial investment of Rs 25 lakh, the trio built their first outlet, called Tpot, in Delhi. The brand specifically targets the tea and snacks market. \n“When we thought of building this startup, we were aware of the demand; we only had to serve the supply. We work on a concept of offering five star quality at roadside vendor prices,” says 31-year-old Robin. \nThe Tpot outlets serve tea in the price range of Rs 49 to Rs 115, with snack prices as low as Rs 49. Growth graph \nRobin says that he ran the first outlet for around 13 months. He wanted to validate the idea before he went on an expansion spree. \nFor over a year, the three co-founders worked on implementing customers’ feedback and looked at how to make their offering more affordable for everyone. \nAfter a year, they started working on the business model and expansion plans. They did a lot of product-based marketing during this time. \nToday, Tpot has 25 outlets across Delhi-NCR and plans to open five more in the city soon. \n“Our 25 outlets clock an average of 3,500 transactions on a daily basis. Tpot has a monthly run-rate of Rs 50 lakh,” says Robin. \nDuring May last year, the New Delhi-based startup had also raised an undisclosed amount in seed funding. The round was led by Ashish Gupta, Founder and Trustee of Ashoka University and Co-founder of Evalueserve. Bias against non-tech biz \nRobin feels that there’s a large bias against non-tech startups in the ecosystem. He himself faced such a bias over the course of building Tpot. Investors just aren’t very keen to invest in such startups. The system also lacks the right advisors when it comes to offering marketing advice to non-tech startups like Tpot. Road ahead \nThe tea retail chain is looking to raise more capital from investors, which it will pump into the expansion of its outlets. \nIt envisages a total investment of $3.5 million over the next 15-18 months, and also aims to double its revenue in the next four months through the opening of more outlets and greater marketing efforts. In the longer term, the aim going forward is to take the revenue to Rs 100 crore in the next three years. \nTpot also plans to tap areas with high footfalls such as metro stations and malls. It also targets multi-city expansion. Expanding chai market \nThe tea market in India is estimated to be worth Rs 33,000 crore, and has been growing at a pace of 15 percent annually. Of late, the tea retail market is largely unorganised, with more than 90 percent of consumption happening through small vendors. However, over the past few years, startups have jumped at the chance to bring tea to the young and busy working class. \nOther prominent tea retail chains are Chai Point, Chaayos and Tea Halt. \nIn 2015, Chaayos had raised $5 million from Tiger Global. In the same year, Chai Point secured $10 million in a round led by Fidelity’s proprietary investment arm, Eight Roads Ventures (formerly Fidelity Growth Partners India), with participation from Saama Capital and DSG Consumer Partners. \nWebsite Calling all Bangalore startups!

      "text": "Mitchell Starc (L) during the first Test. Pic/ AFP \nBangalore: Much before Virat Kohli and his team went down to Australia in the opening Test at Pune last week, the focus had already turned to what the pitch at the Chinnaswamy Stadium, where the second Test begins on Saturday, would offer. Would it assist spin, would they dare to make another turner or would it play low and slow to the Indian team's liking, or would it assist the quicks as it has done at times.\nThese were few questions doing the rounds. But the simple fact of the matter is that the Bangalore centre has rarely been known to throw up an interesting pitch and there certainly is no 'typical Bangalore' wicket.\nAlso Read:  Don't blame me for Pune pitch, says MCA curator Salgaoncar \nPacers, spinners will thrive \nFor this is a pitch on which the great fast bowler Imran Khan once refrained from bowling in the second innings, allowing his spinners to do their thing instead. That was in 1987. Twenty years later, against Pakistan again, India's leading wicket-taker Anil Kumble, left his leg-spin aside and bowled medium pace, thus showing his disgust at the slowness of the track. Pakistan won the earlier while the Kumble Test was a draw.\nAlso Read:  I talk sense so Australians listen to me, says Sridharan Sriram \nIn between the touring Australians twice pulled off wins, the first in 1998 when they won the dead rubber (India had already won the 3-Test series) with Michael Kasprowicz striking. The Indians made 424 in their first innings, showing that it was a good wicket to bat on, Australia replied with 400. That's when Kasprowicz turned it on, a magical haul of five for 28 sending the Indians reeling for 169. Had it anything do with the pitch crumbling? Certainly not. And the Australia romped home to a win, making 195 for the loss of just two wickets.\nThen in 2004, Michael Clarke, now in India as TV pundit but then on his debut, slammed a maiden century to set up another Australia win, eventually leading to a rare series win too. Scores of 474 and 228 by the Aussies to which the Indians replied with 246 and 239 meant that at no stage was the pitch 'Punesque' in nature.\nBowl-first wicket \nTo make it more intriguing, this is one venue where teams winning the toss have chosen to bowl first, something which is almost unheard of in India. The local state team, Karnataka, with a good crop of pacers in their midst, have almost always bowled first for the pitch is known to have something in it for the bowlers on day one and thereafter it becomes a batsman's dream. Even Virat Kohli invited the South Africans to bat first in the last Test played here in November 2015 but then it \nwasn't his pacers but spin twins R Ashwin and R Jadeja who bagged four each, to bowl out the visitors for 214 on \nDay One.\nHeavy rains ensured there was no play on the rest of the days and so everyone was left wondering as to how the pitch would have behaved on Day Two and Three. Since then a multi-crore rupee project has been undertaken to ensure rain delays are minimized but the centre square has not been disturbed.",

      "text": "US-based Hyperloop One today made a strong pitch for Indian market to move people and goods much faster way using magnetic levitation technology. Credit : The Next Web \nOffering super fast transportation solution, the company claims to reduce travel time between Delhi and Mumbai to just 60 minutes and Mumbai to Chennai to 30 minutes. Railway Minister Suresh Prabhu said in New Delhi participating in an event organised by Hyperloop One that, \nSo many new technologies are coming to the fore. We are keenly watching it \nHyperloop is working on a technology that would use magnetic levitation in low-pressure tubes to transport people and goods at airplane-like speeds. Currently the company is involved to operationalise its product in Nevada in the US. \nTerming the Hyperloop technolgy \"very exciting\", Prabhu said \nThink of travelling to Mumbai-Delhi in just 60 minutes and Mumbai to Chennai in 30 minutes. We will closely watch it how it is happening. \nHe said Indian Railways has undertaken a massive exercise of modernisation of infrastructure and also increasing speed. \nSpeed is also our focus. We are trying to increase the average speed of all trains. Recently we have initiated steps to increase speed on the Delhi-Mumbai and Delhi-Howrah route on the existing track, the Railway Minister said. \nReferring to India's first bullet train project with Japanese participation, he said the ground work for the Mumbai-Ahmedabad route is expected to start in 2018. Also read: Bengaluru to Chennai in 30 minutes! Elon Musk’s Hyperloop all set to enter India \nHighlighting the procedures of foreign participation, Prabhu referred to the selection of two global companies - GE and Alstom in manufacturing of electric and diesel locomotives. \nWe follow most transparent system. Our minds are open. GE and Alstom were selected for manufacturing diesel and electric locomotives in the country through a most transparent bidding system. \nNITI Ayog CEO Amitabh Kant said that \"rapid urbanisation\" is taking place in the country. The nation is passing through a huge vibrancy and dynamism. The urbanisation has ended in the US and it has just begun in India. It has billion mobiles key to India's growth is how to transform the process of urbanisation, Kant said. \nHighlighting the need for substantial growth, he said, transportation is a challenge. \nWe are doing innovative things, dedicated freight corridor (DFC) is coming up for faster movement of goods. It takes 13 to 14 days to transport goods from north to south. But in the upcoming DFC it would take 14 hours. So from 14 days to 14 hours. \nThe NITI Ayog CEO said for the faster movement of the people and goods, the only way is to do is through technology. He said Hyperloop presents the transformational technology and India would be happy to join the venture. \nWe will be happy to facilitate and act as a catalyst and to work in partnership with you, Kant added.

      "text": "It took investigators from the Anti-Corruption Bureau 6 hours to put a number to what they had seen inside the wardrobe . There were 7,000 saris in all manner of design and material, clearly worth crores of rupees. And these were only some of the items found during a raid on Tuesday at the house of the Deputy Commissioner , Commercial Taxes , in Hubballi . \n\nAccording to sources, the entire room was full of saris, which were reportedly being used by the wife of the official, Kariayappa N. When they asked her about it, she claimed she was running a business but then, on further questioning, couldn't substantiate the claim with evidence. \n\n\"It took almost 6 hours to see and count every sari in the house. The wife of an official from the commercial taxes department having so many expensive saris is hard to believe. It is possible that he may have raided sari shops and kept the clothes,\" an ACB officer said. \n\nWhile the saris alone would collectively be worth a few crores, investigators also found several documents for properties owned by him, his wife and relatives, including three houses, a flat in Bengaluru, agricultural land, and plots. They also found jewellery, shoes, watches and accessories. The couple's two children are studying abroad. \n\n\nBBMP's TenderSURE man owns 150 acres \n\nThe house of KT Nagaraj, a Chief Engineer with the Bruhat Bengaluru Mahanagara Palike (BBMP) -- who is also in charge of TenderSURE works across Bengaluru -- was raided by the ACB investigators on Tuesday morning. \n\nInvestigators found several kilograms of gold jewellery in addition to property papers under names of various family members at his house in Jayanagar, 3rd Block. \n\nA senior ACB official said they found that he had bought 150 acres of coffee estate in Sakleshpur and Hassan districts in his own name as well as his wife's and relative's. \n\n\"We also found more than 10 kg of gold, Rs 7 lakh cash in new currency, five high-end cars, property documents for four plots in Bengaluru, two houses and one commercial complex. Two more lockers are yet to be checked. He has been buying the estate for the last five years and the most recent purchase has been done last year. Nagaraj was heading major roads at BBMP as chief engineer and was then transferred to head of all projects. He was heading the whole TenderSURE project across Bengaluru,\" the officer said. \n\nPD Kumar, Assistant Executive Engineer, Bangalore Development Authority (BDA), was also raided by the ACB, which found properties worth crores of rupees, and Rs 2 lakh cash. They found that he had two houses, six sites in Bengaluru and Davanagere, commercial complex at JP Nagar, and agricultural land of around 10 acres at Harapanahalli. \n\nThe raids were also conducted on five other government officials from various departments: Saleem Sabusab, deputy tahasildar, Belagavi; PD Kumar, Assistant Executive Engineer, BDA; Karunakar, RTO Senior Inspector from Shivamogga; Jagannath from Bidar Taluk Panchayat; and A Shivakumar, a PDO from Gadag. Crores of illegal wealth was found during the raids. \n\n\nACB's LOOT \n\n\nKariayappa N \n\n* 10,000 sq ft plot at Yeshwantpur \n* Duplex house worth 1 crore in Hubli \n* Flat in Hesaraghatta \n* Two plots in Hubli \n* Two sites (2,500 sq ft) at Manjunath Nagar \n* 20 acres farm land in Koliwada village \n* 4 acres in Navalgund \n\n\nKT Nagaraj, BBMP \n\n\n* 150 acres of coffee estate \n* 3,500 sq ft site Dasanapura \n* 5 guntas in KR Puram \n* Flat in Nagavara \n* Commercial complex in Mysore \n* 2,500 sq ft house in Jayanagar \n* 4,000 sq ft building in JP Nagar \n* 4,000 sq ft site in Jala Hobli \n* 30 gunta land at Magadi \n* Site in Hassan \n* 5 high-end cars \n* Diamond ring, gold and silver",

      "title": "Kathmandu's Extreme Metal Scene Puts Nepal on the Global Metal Map",
      "text": "Kathmandu's Extreme Metal Scene Puts Nepal on the Global Metal Map From Kathmandu to the hinterlands of the Himalayan foothills, extreme metal gains a foothold in the second-highest country on earth. \nIn our current hyper-connected age, there are very few heretofore uncharted spaces left in the extreme metal atlas. By the late 90s, extreme music had permeated, to some extent, most places on earth—but even then, not everywhere had enjoyed the rank privilege of becoming jaded. In some places, local metal heads were only entering the first stage of the equation. Small groups of diehards were starting their first extreme bands, and hosting the first metal nights at pubs whose owners were unfamiliar with the harsh, new style of music, entirely foreign to their ears. They slowly introduced a heavier, faster, eviler, and more dangerous brand of metal to rock fans hungry for something new. One of those places was the landlocked Himalayan nation of Nepal. \n\"Nepal's extreme music scene started from the end of 90s when Ugrakarma introduced themselves in Kathmandu and Suicide Theory in Hetauda,\" says Visha Rai, extreme metal promoter in Kathmandu and front man of now defunct Nepalese grindcore band Wakk Thuu. \n\"Ugrakarma came out with their debut album, Blood Metal Initiation, in the early 2000s. Suicide Theory played few shows. Also, X-Mantra came out with their album, Crying For Peace ,\" Rai says of the early days when Nepalese bands started moving on from putting out demos and singles to releasing the country's first extreme metal full-lengths. In the early days of the Nepalese scene, heavy music was spread the old school way, says fellow promoter Zivon Gurung, who works closely with Rai to promulgate extreme metal in Nepal, he operating out of the city of Pokhara. \n\"During the early days we did not have internet,\" Gurung recalls. \"Kids back then would buy ugly-looking pirated cassettes and would trade with each other and learn to play by listening to them. They would teach each other, set up listening sessions, jam and what not.\" \nRai and Gurung each started their own extreme metal appreciation societies, Rai heading the Extreme Underground Metal Society of Nepal, Gurung at the helm of an organization known as Brutal Pokhara. The two joined forces, hoping to grow the nascent scene into an active player on the Southeast Asian regional circuit. Of course, things started small. \n\"EUMSN's first show was attended by 20 people,\" says Rai of the society's first foray into show promotion, a gig called Brutal Lunchbox that took place in a jam spot. \"These 20 people joined along with rest of the band members to start the new culture in Nepal. The mosh pit of this show was extremely wild and the sickest to date. You ask to any bands who played that show they still talk about this pit. Everyone was throwing themselves on each other, bodies were flying everywhere. Some were moshing naked, some were hurt, girls were screaming their lungs out, the door was broken, and still no fights.\" \nFrom those humble beginnings, says Gurung, the Nepalese scene evolved relatively quickly. The bands got tighter. The number of fans increased. And the atmosphere at gigs, where some fans used to sit on the floor, unsure of how to react to the violent new form of music, grew more energetic. \n\"The scene on the whole has grown a lot,\" Gurung says. \"The number of shows has risen up considerably, not just in Kathmandu and Pokhara but other cities as well, and so has the number of gig attendees. The fans have become more supportive towards attending shows and buying CDs and merch. The mosh pits are becoming bigger and more and more electrifying and violent. We can now proudly boast that Nepalese mosh pits are some of the most chaotic ones you could find anywhere.\" \nNepal now boasts a semi-regular touring circuit for local an international bands, a route test-driven for the first time on the Extreme Underground Tour of 2013 when Nepalese extreme metal favorites such as Dying Out Flame and Aakrosh hit Kathmandu, Nepal, and Hetauda. Today EUMSN is active in six cities throughout the country, and has even branched out into neighboring India. \nIt's only in the past few years that international touring bands have started headlining Nepal's first attempts at putting on major extreme metal events. In 2010 Swiss death metal act Enigmatik was the first to test the waters. Polish death metal legends Vader headlined Kathmandu's Silence Fest II the following year, while Birmingham grindcore lifers Napalm Death and another Polish death metal mainstay, Decapitated, would follow in the ensuing years. For the fans in Nepal, the sporadic appearance of international headliners presents a rare opportunity, international travel being difficult for most Nepalese for both economic and political reasons. \n\"Nepalese are always eager to see those bands here because, first, they can't go to see them live outside this country, event to India,\" says Rai. \n\"The ever-changing political scenario here also doesn't help much, and then there is the huge currency variation issue,\" Gurung elaborates. \"Nepal has one of the lowest currency values. Most foreigners also think that there is no respectable scene and that no extreme music exists here. But when they come and play, we always give them one of the most remarkable experiences.\" \nAs for the future of the Nepalese extreme scene, the next edition of what has been a yearly event since 2014, Nepal Deathfest, is set to take place on March 10 and 11 in Kathmandu. This year, the headliner is long-running German brutal death metal machine Defeated Sanity. As it is with many in the international metal community, bassist Jacob Schmidt says he only had the most cursory knowledge of the extreme scene in Nepal until the invitation to go and play there came through. \n\"I have a few people from Nepal on Facebook and I remember seeing fliers of Nepal Deathfest on there,\" Schmidt recalls. \"That was pretty much my only connection until we got contacted if we want to play this fest and do a tour around it.\" \nPart of the appeal of playing in Nepal no doubt has to do with the perpetual desire of the touring band to break new territory. Of course, the proximity to the world's highest mountain can't hurt, either. The boys in Defeated Sanity won't be making it to the Mount Everest Base Camp this time, unfortunately. But if all goes well, who knows what the next tour to Nepal might bring. \n\"Unfortunately we won't spend any more days in Nepal besides the show date because we are moving on to Bangkok afterwards,\" says Schmidt. \"We have two off days on the tour though and hope to spend them doing cool things. I'd really love to do a little hike in the Himalayas next time!\" \nAnd so the extreme metal scene in Nepal moves steadily forward. These days, Kathmandu plays host to one or two gigs a month, and the country is currently home to somewhere in the neighborhood of 100 underground metal bands of varying ilk. Outside the capital, in towns such as Dharan and Biratnagar, gigs happen sporadically thanks to the efforts of EUSMN, which has even grown to develop its own splinter groups—one of which is run entirely by women. \n\"Recently, a group of women from Kathmandu came together to start EUMSN Sisters to support extreme music,\" Rai explains. \"The future looks beautiful but, it depends on those states of mind. Are they going to continue here, or will they move out to make their life? Staying in extreme music will cost you a lot. If you don't have passion and that strong state of mind then sooner or later you will give up.\" \n\"If it keeps growing at a similar rate, it is going to be huge,\" adds Gurung. \"We will have one of the strongest scenes in Asia for sure. Monetarily, obviously, we cannot compete with the likes of Japan or Indonesia or most of our Asian counterparts, but passion is here in abundance. We already have many foreign bands come and play here and there will be plenty of them in 2017 as well. They love playing in Nepal, and we love having them here. Things will only get better.\" X-Mantra \nNepal's only consistently active metal band dating back to the scene's first days less than 20 years ago, X-Mantra play a meld of old school meets new school thrash tinged with a bit of death metal coming through at times, like a mix of early era and latter day Sepultura. The band's lyrics are sung in their native tongue, and the group have earned a strong following at home, describing themselves humbly as cult favorites of the Kathmandu Valley. Ugrakarma \nUgrakarma were also formed in the Nepalese scene's early days in the late nineties, getting together to play what they call \"Himalayan Metal of Death,\" a title which also became the name of the band's first demo in the year 2000. Their name comes from the Sanskrit for \"a malicious action,\" and the sound is pure old school death metal with a high mountain flavor on tracks with titles such as \"Annapurna the Serial Killer\" and \"Mount Blasphemy.\" Hailing from Kathmandu, the band has had releases put out internationally, most notably by French label Legion of Death, which released the band's latest seven-inch, Mountain Grinders, in 2015. Dying Out Flame \nPerhaps the most prominent Nepalese extreme band on the world stage, thanks to a deal with Spain's Xtreem Music, and due to the band taking home the 2014 award for Best Asian Metal Album from the U.K.'s Global Metal Apocalypse, Kathmandu's Dying Out Flame have had a chance to introduce their brand of death metal, inspired in part by Vedic rituals, Hindu philosophy, and Sanskrit chants, to a larger portion of the international community than most of their local counterparts. Formed in 2011, the band takes a somewhat mystical, spiritual approach to modern technical death metal, using the guitar to simulate the sounds of the sitar, and introducing eastern classical rhythms to the genre's usual blast beats and alternate picking chug. Binaash \nKathmandu's Binaash, which features guitarist Prateek Raj Neupane, also of Ugrakarma, plays a mix of brutal death metal and acerbic, humor-laden grind a la Birdflesh. Formed in 2009, the band's name means \"Destruction\" in Nepali, and they have dubbed their grinding take on death metal as \"ramailo death metal,\" or \"fun death metal.\" So far, the band's output consists of one full length (Binaashkaari, 2012), a split, and an EP that came out in 2016. Nude Terror \nOf all the offshoots and branches of extreme metal, those in the know say grindcore enjoys the largest following in Nepal. One of the most prominent acts in this sub-sect is Nude Terror. Playing a socially conscious brand of straight ahead grind, the band has been featured regularly on the bills of the country's one-off shows and mini-fests, such as the aforementioned Brutal Lunchbox and Nepal Deathfest, since forming in 2012. The band has also made a few trips into India, having gigged in Hyderabad, Bangalore, and Kurseong, enjoying the fruits of a regional touring circuit between the neighboring nations that has formed in recent years through grassroots efforts. Aakrosh \nThough they have yet to put out so much as a demo, Aakrosh have already won themselves a loyal following in their hometown of Kathmandu and throughout Nepal, fans embracing their take on old school/technical death metal like a tahr to the Himalayan steppes (look it up). The band has been going strong since 2012, honing their sound in what looks to be, according to videos on YouTube, the most cramped jam room on the Asian continent. Undefined Human \nAnother band that has managed to win itself a following in Nepal based solely thus far on live performances is Undefined Human. Hailing from the town of Hetauda, about 130 kilometers southwest of Kathmandu, Undefined Human has imported the old school Finnish and Swedish death metal sound to their native land, bringing a bit of far east groove to the genre. Nothing modern or trendy here. This is a band that keeps their metal of death strictly within the bounds of the genre's gore-soaked halcyon days. Disorder \nThrash too has made inroads in Nepal, and one of the forerunners of the modern-day thrash scene in the country is Lalitpur/Kathmandu old school ragers Disorder. Taking a no-frills approach to the bullet belt thrash of early Sodom along with the punk-infused attitude of crossover artists such as D.R.I. and Suicidal Tendencies, the young thrashers in Disorder have kept busy gigging around their home country since forming in 2013, taking time to record a demo the year after their formation. The band recently wrapped another mini-tour of Nepal in mid-December. \nJoe Henley is flying high on Twitter .All photos courtesy of the Extreme Underground Metal Society of Nepa l",

      "text": "Flipboard \nAlthough Indian businesses have progressed considerably in recent years, becoming competitive on a global scale, Indian MSMEs have largely been left behind in this shift. While its larger counterparts are driving higher revenues and better margins, why is the Indian MSME stranded away from the rest of the global village? \n“ We definitely want to export, but we don’t know where and how to start. How do we figure out what to export, where to export, at what price, and most importantly, how to export? We don’t have any in-house export experts. We don’t have enough capital for executing export orders. ” \nThese are some of the general comments I hear during the course of my conversations with Indian MSMEs that want to ‘go global’ but are not able to do so. Global trade is perceived as risky and complex, especially for MSMEs in developing nations. I myself had faced a steep learning curve when I founded my own global trading company. From engaging with a global audience to arranging an order to executing it, the process is fairly complicated. Moreover, the associated risk is real, and brings with it a lot of ‘what if’s: What if the buyer is not genuine? What if you don’t get payment for the order? What if you can’t execute the order at the agreed price or within the stipulated timeframe? \nThe result is easy to see - less than one million of the around 50 million MSMEs in India currently export. The government has initiated wide-ranging programmes, such as Make in India, Digital India, Skills India, Startup India and Stand Up India, with the aim of transforming India into a global economic power. The MSMEs have a crucial role to play in the success of these programmes and they will be instrumental if India is to meet ambitious targets like raising the manufacturing sector contribution in GDP to 25 percent by 2020, achieving $900 billion in exports by 2020, and becoming a $10 trillion economy by 2032. \nUnfortunately, inspite of various government schemes and policies, the growth of the MSME segment, especially in the context of ‘going global’, has been anemic. Moreover, given the current global economic scenario , it’s high time we aggressively market to aim at the limited orders available globally as well extend our presence in newer markets. It’s time to think up out-of-the-box solutions to promote Indian exports. \nTrade professionals can play a pivotal role in helping achieve that. For instance, why don’t we encourage trade professionals to become global trade entrepreneurs? These professionals have the best knowledge, and are well versed with all pre-export, during-export and after-export policies, paperwork and procedure. The skill to locate suitable and verified overseas customers for products, in addition to building the best marketing strategy, lies mostly with these professionals, as they have years of experience in the trends and depths of the global market. These trade professionals have the required skill, experience, and knowledge to become global trade entrepreneurs and make their contribution to meeting the goal of growing Indian exports manifold. \nHowever, the challenge here lies in the fact that professionals in this segment are not very keen to start their own businesses given factors like the risk involved, lack of adequate capital, limited expertise in technology and lack of access to trade information sources. So, the need is to mitigate business risk, motivate, and incentivise, as well as to make it easy for these individuals to start their own businesses. This needs planning, encouragement, favourable government policies and trade platforms where they can get started easily. For example, the government could create a specialised credit scheme within the existing credit guarantee schemes for this segment, provide marketing and branding support to this segment, and announce incentives for global trade professionals turning into global trade entrepreneurs, along similar lines as the government has done for encouraging digital adoption within the country. \nThere are lots of MSMEs who understand the value of technology, digital presence and trade intelligence, but they still need guidance and support in the initial stages to get and execute their first couple of export orders. The global trade professionals could lead the next wave of global trade entrepreneurship in India, helping drive exports from these MSMEs. Continued support from the government, global trade entrepreneurship by trade professionals, and access to smart and integrated trade platforms with end-to-end global trade offerings are some of the things that would enable our MSMEs to be globally aware, globally visible and globally competitive. \nThere is a lot of scope for this model of global trade entrepreneurship in India, as evident from the fact that 40 percent of current exports are carried out by merchant exporters. If given the right opportunity and platform, these trade professionals could work independently and start their own exports businesses, where they could either set up their own export-oriented manufacturing unit or get exports done for products manufactured by multiple MSME manufacturers by acting as either merchant exporters or trading companies. \nThis would not only increase the export value from India through both intelligent trading as well as trading with the right market, but would also eventually lead to a hike in the number of global trade entrepreneurs and global trade professionals from India, hence making a contribution to the global trade ecosystem like never before. \nThese entrepreneurs could accelerate exports from India exponentially and revolutionise the way we do global trade in the years to come. In addition to having the best insight into the market, strategies for mitigating trade risk, and economical as well as political factors that affect the flow of products, these new age global trade entrepreneurs would help contribute to the global trade ecosystem by building the most apt strategy to uplift exports from India. \n(Disclaimer: The views and opinions expressed in this article are those of the author and do not necessarily reflect the views of YourStory.)

By Michael Alison Chandler By Michael Alison Chandler February 28 at 7:59 PM Follow @michaelalison Mike Keller listens to a teacher during science class at Lakelands Park Middle School in Gaithersburg, Md. (Sarah L. Voisin/The Washington Post) \nIn a science class at Lakelands Park Middle School, 13-year-old Mike Keller sat between his professional aide and his science partner during a lesson about how force affects balance. The Montgomery County teen, who has autism, stood up a few times in a burst of energy and once walked out of the room. But with some redirection from his aide, he appeared to focus on a series of questions that his teacher posted on the whiteboard. \nHis teacher asked him an easy yes-or-no question at one point, and as an aide held a keyboard in front of him, Mike typed the word “Yes” on the iPad, followed by a touch of sarcasm: “Duh.” \nMike is not able to speak. He points at letters on a laminated alphabet board or types on a keyboard that an aide holds. Nationally, most students who can’t talk are in self-contained classrooms or autism programs or, like Mike used to be, in a separate school for students with severe disabilities. \nBut five years ago, Mike and his mother traveled to Texas to explore a novel communication technique called Rapid Prompting Method that led to what his family describes as a breakthrough. About a year later, he joined a new pilot program in Montgomery County Public Schools for autistic students who rely on keyboards and communication partners. \nMontgomery County is unusual, if not unique, in creating such a program. Many schools have denied similar requests for programs that allow rapid prompting, or a similar technique known as facilitated communication that was widely discredited by the scientific community in the 1990s. \nA generation later, there is a resurgence of non­speaking students who type to communicate and rely on a communication partner through various techniques. Active communities of “typers” are growing in Southern California, Michigan, Boston, Atlanta and the D.C. region, areas where families have access to private training. As their numbers grow, more families are pushing for their children to be included in public schools. \nIn an autism world with few documented treatments and many high-cost promises, the use of these techniques has stirred strong emotions. Critics say they offer false hope to desperate families, while advocates argue that they help some people and that it is wrong to stop exploring the only means some may have of communicating. \nIn Arlington, Va., the Autistic Self Advocacy Network filed a discrimination complaint last spring with the Justice Department on behalf of five nonspeaking students — dubbed the “Arlington Five” — whose requests to use letter boards and trained communication supporters to access general education were denied by the school district. By denying students their “preferred communication method,” the complaint stated, they are being “prevented from communicating their thoughts, ideas, and feelings,” and “being consigned to an inferior education with fewer opportunities and lower expectations.” \nBrenda Wilks, an assistant superintendent overseeing special education for the Arlington County schools, said in a statement that the district “will continue to explore best prac­tices and educational research in this area as we evaluate the use and potential benefit of [Rapid Prompting Method] and other related methodologies to support our students.” \nCritics point to research that indicates the techniques are not effective. \nIn response to an international resurgence in the use of facilitated communication, Ralf W. Schlosser, a professor of communication sciences and disorders at Northeastern University, led a systematic review in 2014 of more than 20 studies of the technique. It found overwhelming support that the facilitator was controlling the message. \n“In the field of augmentative communication, we want to empower people with disabilities to speak their own minds, so if someone else is speaking, that is a big problem,” he said. \nBut advocates question some of the research methodologies and say better training and newer techniques, including rapid prompting, offer safeguards against facilitator influence. \nUnderlying the debate, some maintain, is a fundamental civil rights question. \n“When Helen Keller first learned to communicate, no one believed her,” said Vikram Jaswal, a University of Virginia psychologist who has an elementary-aged daughter with autism who he said is learning to spell to communicate. “We routinely segregate people who can’t talk. Why do we assume they can’t learn?” Different approaches \nFirst developed in Australia, facilitated communication was introduced in the United States in 1990 when Douglas Biklen, a Syracuse University education professor, wrote about it for the Harvard Education Review. \nIt was embraced enthusiastically as a miracle technique that could unlock the potential of people who had been written off as very low functioning. There were media reports of people previously thought to be mentally retarded graduating from high school or writing lyrical poetry. \nIn facilitated communication, a trained facilitator helps the nonverbal person type by supporting their arm, wrist or hand. It is based on the theory that autism has a significant motor component, and many have difficulty with intentional movement and so need physical support to demonstrate what they know. \nSyracuse established an Institute for Facilitated Communication and trained thousands of facilitators, many of them public school educators, from across the country. \nIts downfall was swift and steep. A series of controlled studies in the 1990s found strong evidence that the communication was extremely susceptible to facilitator influence. In so-called message passing tests, when the subject was asked about something that the facilitator could not know, the responses were routinely inaccurate. Researchers found that facilitators were unaware they were influencing the response. \nAt the same time, in dozens of cases, nonverbal people made accusations of sexual assault through their facilitators. Some highly publicized allegations involved a parent or family member. Judges found these claims to be false, and the facilitated messages unreliable. \nBy 1994, the American Psychological Association adopted a position statement opposing the use of facilitated communication. Other professional organizations followed suit. \nPublic schools, for the most part, closed their doors tight to the practice. \nThe center at Syracuse never closed, although it changed its name to the Institute on Communication and Inclusion. And Christine Ashby, its director, said that interest in facilitated communication did not go away and has increased in recent years. \nA handful of school districts — including those in Syracuse, N.Y., Barre, Vt., and Whittier, Calif. — have trained teachers and supported students over time, Ashby said. But most considered each case individually and provided services quietly. \nThe institute promotes standards of practice designed to reduce the chance for facilitator influence, including providing the least amount of physical support possible, and training typers to work with multiple facilitators, Ashby said. \n“It grew too fast, without the right procedures in place, and a lot of poorly trained facilitators,” she said. \nAt the same time, rapid prompting, which is not taught at the Syracuse institute, has gained traction among nonspeaking people with autism. \nThe approach was popularized in the United States by Soma Mukhopadhyay, a chemist by training from India who dedicated her life to educating her autistic son. \nPractitioners say the approach is fundamentally different from facilitated communication because, in rapid prompting, an aide typically holds a keyboard but does not touch the person typing. \nThe process involves using verbal encouragement and tactile stimulation derived from having someone hold the board. Such prompts are supposed to help the person initiate movement and stay focused on typing despite sensory distractions. \nThere is very little research on rapid prompting, in part because Mukhopadhyay has resisted participating in studies. \nCritics say this method is also highly susceptible to facilitator influence. They describe it as a process of learning to respond to increasingly subtle cues. \nHoward Shane, director of the Center for Communication Enhancement and the Autism Language Program at Boston Children’s Hospital, questioned the validity of any communication method that requires the physical help of someone else. \n“We have five different ways of controlling a computer with your eyes,” he said. “We can most of the time find some way for them to communicate independently.” \nShane said he has seen nonverbal autistic people create full sentences independently but has never seen high levels of intellect suddenly unlocked. \nMatthew Belmonte, a neuroscientist at Nottingham Trent University in Britain and a visiting researcher at a Bangalore clinic that teaches communication techniques similar to rapid prompting, said the method’s theoretical underpinnings are sound and some nonspeaking people with motor impairments can potentially benefit. \nResearch is needed, he said, to ascertain whether, for whom and in what contexts the technique works, and to improve and automate the process. \n“We have to be very careful if we are denying the veracity of potentially the only means of communication that some people have,” he said. Mike Keller uses a keyboard and iPad to communicate with his mother, Lori Mitchell-Keller, in their home in Gaithersburg, Md. (Sarah L. Voisin/The Washington Post) ‘He had been there all along’ \nIn the decade after her son’s autism diagnosis, Lori Mitchell-Keller spent untold hours pursuing treatments. \n“I can count on one hand the things that worked,” she said. \nThen in 2012, she learned about Mukhopadhyay, who ­teaches her method to a growing list of families from an office in Austin. \nMitchell-Keller arranged for Mike to take lessons from her over the course of a week. \nThe results astonished her, she said. It appeared to her that Mike not only knew how to read and spell but that he also had been comprehending far more than they had imagined. \n“I realized he had been paying attention, he had been there all along,” she said. Back at home, their family transformed as they got to know a boy who, his mother said, is bright, spiritual and affectionate. \nMike joined the Montgomery pilot program and enrolled in typical fifth-grade classes. The program started in fall 2013 with five boys, some using facilitated communication and some using rapid prompting. \nA few more students have been added since, but the program will remain small without further evidence of the effectiveness of the techniques, said special education director Philip Lynch. Mike Keller communicates by spelling words on a keyboard. He typed this text into the machine, which spoke the words. (Sarah L. Voisin/The Washington Post) \nOfficials are monitoring the students for progress toward independent communication, as well as social and emotional progress, Lynch said. He noted that Mike had made friends at his school and said: “How do you measure the impact of being included in your public school?” \nAfter four years of practice, Mitchell-Keller said her son is making progress toward fully independent communication. He is now able to type without someone holding the keyboard, although the process tires him much more quickly, she said. \nOn a late November afternoon, Mike sat with the keyboard on the kitchen table in front of him and answered a few questions from a reporter about his Thanksgiving. \n“My thanksngi mm. was golden,” he typed. \n“my cousin Theo” visited and “really had great trimester here,” he wrote, with auto correct filling in the word “trimester.” “HE IS FROM. MINNESOTAN,” he wrote. \nHe yawned widely while he slowly typed the letters and hit the backspace key and typed again. Mike Keller sits on the couch with his father, Eric Keller. (Sarah L. Voisin/The Washington Post) Mike takes his father's hand to change into his pajamas after doing his Spanish homework with his mother. (Sarah L. Voisin/The Washington Post) \nMitchell-Keller, who travels extensively for work, said her son has worked with dozens of communication partners. When she is with him, she usually holds the keyboard, but this time she sat next to him without touching it. She reminded him to sit up straight, and she read the letters he typed aloud and encouraged him to keep going. She kept one hand on the edge of the table or underneath it. With the other, she held the tip of his collar between her forefinger and thumb. \n“I am not even sure he feels it. I am not touching his skin, but I think it gives him a level of reassurance,” she said. “He’s not all on his own. There’s a lifeline there.” local",

      "text": "News » Sports » Cricket Virat Kohli fails to maintain MS Dhoni's record of unbeaten run against Aussies at home \nMS Dhoni, who played 88 Tests for India, remained unbeaten against the Aussies on home soil as a skipper. By Zee Media Bureau | Last Updated: Monday, February 27, 2017 - 13:11 0 Follow @ZeeNewsSports \nNew Delhi: Virat Kohli-led India were given a reality check by the visiting Australian side as Steve Smith's men registered a comprehensive 333-run win in the first Test. With the shocking defeat, India's 19-match unbeaten run at home also came to an end. \nThe defeat was a reality check for the Indian team, who looked invincible during their long home season. \nSince being appointed as the skipper of the Test team, Kohli had not tasted defeats on many occasions. While the Aussies overshadowed India in all departments of the game in Pune, the loss also ensured that Kohli will no longer be able to match a record set by former captain MS Dhoni. \nDhoni, who played 88 Tests for India, remained unbeaten against the Aussies on home soil. The Ranchi-born cricketer led India against Australia in eight matches at home, winning all of them. \nIn 2008/09, Dhoni led the team to a 2-0 series win over Australia. Things were no different for the team from Down Under in 2010/11 as they lost another series by the same margin. \nIn 2012/13, India hammered the Aussies 4-0, in a series which saw Dhoni hitting a power-packed double ton. \nKohli, who has been in sublime form across formats lately, had a forgettable Test match at Pune, where he also registered his maiden duck on home soil. In the first innings, Kohli edged a wide ball from Mitchell Starc into Smith's hands. \nIn the second innings, where the hosts were given a huge 441-run target, Kohli failed to read a straight ball from Steve O'Keefe which possibly was the final nail in the coffin. \nThe second Test is scheduled to be played at M Chinnaswamy Stadium in Bangalore from March 4.

      "text": "Follow @ZeeNewsSports \nNew Delhi: Mitchell Starc may have won the opening duel against Indian skipper Virat Kohli by getting the star batsman out for a duck in the first Test, but the Australian fast bowler insists the battle has just begun. \nStarc triggered India`s downfall in last week`s first Test in Pune by claiming the wickets of Cheteshwar Pujara and Kohli in quick succession in the first innings before left-arm spinner Steve O`Keefe took charge. \nAustralia bowled out India for paltry totals of 105 and 107 in the two innings, with O`Keefe taking a total of 12 wickets as the visitors wrapped up a 333-run win inside three days. \nKohli, who has been in red-hot form in recent months, had a rare failure with scores of 0 and 13 in his two outings. \nGuilty of chasing Starc`s wide delivery outside the off-stump, Kohli gave away a catch to Peter Handscomb at first slip and the batting soon fell apart on a sharply turning wicket. \n\"We know (Kohli) is going to be another key wicket for the rest of the series. There`s six more times we`ve got to get him out to really cement this series,\" Starc told reporters. \n\"We know he`ll come back bigger and stronger, but he`s one I`ll take over Pujara at the moment,\" Starc said when asked to rate the importance of his twin strikes in Pune. \nStarc and Kohli are former team-mates for the Indian Premier League (IPL) side Royal Challengers Bangalore, and the Australian is well aware of how dangerous the Indian skipper can be once he gets his eye in. \n\"He`s a class player, we all know that. He`s scored a mountain of runs already this year. We`re going to have to be wary of that Virat comeback,\" Starc said of Kohli, who has scored double centuries in four successive series. \n\"We are really happy that it happened that way for us, but we know that one Test is not going to win us the series. It`s three important Test matches to go.\" \nAfter the next Test in Bangalore, the two teams are also due to play in Ranchi and Dharamsala.

Written by Manoj Kumar R | Bengaluru | Published:February 28, 2017 7:16 pm Priya Anand will make her Kannada debut with Raajakumara \nActor Priya Anand is all excited about her debut Kannada film Raajakumara, even as she is very impressed with the kind of women-centric films the Sandalwood industry has produced of late. \n“I’m really, really surprised with the kind of movies being made in Kannada, like U-Turn. There are female-oriented films being made without a big star. In Tamil industry, if you were to make such films, it will have to be with Nayanthara or someone like that. They (Tamil filmmakers) don’t just make movies with newcomers or random actors,” she said. “The Kannada industry is really changing and it is looking really interesting.” \nShe said that not just commercial films but she would also love to be a part of more meaningful movies in Kannada. She finds speaking Kannada easy as it is very similar to Telugu and she hopes to be fluent in the language before her next Kannada film. \nThe actor made a big debut in Malayalam recently with Ezra, which had Prithviraj in the lead role. The horror-drama has emerged as a winner at the Kerala box office. \nPriya will now debut in Kannada alongside Sandalwood’s big movie star, Puneeth Rajkumar. “I play a salsa dancer in the film. The worst part was that I had to teach Puneeth how to salsa dance, which is like most ridiculous thing. Everyone knows what an amazing dancer he is. But, I really enjoyed myself (during the shooting). I had fun shooting with Sarathkumar sir, Prakash Rai sir, Sadhu Kokila sir and other Kannada actors,” she said. More from the world of Entertainment: \nPriya said that she was offered a slew of films before Raajakumara but the main reason she signed this film was because of its director. “I was in Bangalore and I saw Mr. and Mrs. Ramachari, directed by Santhosh Ananddram, and I ended up loving it. When I got a call from Santhosh, I was totally kicked. For me it wasn’t just working with Puneeth but also working with a very good director,” she said. \nPriya said that she has a few film offers in Malayalam and Tamil in the pipeline and announcements on her future projects will be made soon. In the meantime, she is also part of the sequel to 2013 Bollywood film, Fukrey. \nThe family entertainer film, Raajakumara, is expected to hit the screens on March 24. © The Indian Express Online Media Pvt Ltd",

      "text": "Uncategorized Startup Kolkata is turning digital, a media agency working for 2000 brands in Kolkata, achieved 5 crore turnover Flipboard \nDipak Agarwal, Founder of OneX Solutions , shares his experience of starting his own company \nDipak says, “In India, the retail segment is not that organised in doing business. They have never thought of a database to be an asset of a company. I wanted to help such clients organise their database. It’s important to make them realise that just normal day-to-day trading is just not enough in this digital era. It’s very much important to update your database with contact numbers and email IDs. To keep existing customers intact or hooked the core is to how to use your existing data and enhance your business opportunities.” \nWith this frame of mind, Dipak established OneX Solutions in January 2013 as the sole founder. He is a chartered accountant and has had one year’s experience working for Ernst and Young. Team OneX Solutions What does OneX Solutions do? \nOneX Solutions provides services in digital marketing. It deals in bulk SMS, bulk email, voice call, VMN, and digital-based solutions. It helps clients in promoting and marketing their products/services via SMS and email. Through its lead generation campaigns, it helps clients build customers. It has a pan-India database of various profile like salaried class, pincode-wise data, car owners, postpaid mobile users, etc. \nDipak shares, \" We have tried to educate our clients about the importance of having their own data. The Indian tradition of keeping things on books and papers was a big hurdle we had to face. Making the client tech-savvy is a big-time thing. We focused on assembling all the scattered data and bringing it to a one-point centre. Thereafter, the team has assisted them in converting the data into soft copy Excel format. This culture has infused a habit in them to update their records properly and in a timely manner.\" \nThe USP of the service lies in its ability to hit the target audience of the client as per their industry standards and nature of business. It has helped clients reach their customers on various occasions like anniversary time, stock out sale, announcement of new products, etc Market size \nThe digital media industry in India is estimated at around Rs 35,000 crore. OneX Solutions’ corporate office is in Kolkata. It also has virtual offices in Mumbai and Delhi. \nThe company has been growing at the rate of 50 percent every year since inception and expects to grow by 100 percent by 2017. Its revenues over the last three years have been more than Rs 5 crore and with the launch of their new product M-Classifieds, should touch Rs 20 crore for FY 17–18. \nThe company has a team of 12 people, divided into departments like customer support, sales, back office admin, etc. It is bootstrapping as of now. It has always believed in generating money through up-sale and has aimed to design products which are profit-driven. \nCalling all Bangalore startups!

      "text": "Indiatimes February 28, 2017 \nMitchell Starc won the opening duel against Virat Kohli by getting him out for a duck in the first Test, but the Aussie pacer insists the battle is far from over. \nBCCL \nAlso Read: V irat Kohli And His Boys Will Soon Lose 'Star' From Their Jersey As The Company Is Not Bidding For Sponsorship Rights \nStarc triggered India's downfall in last week's first Test in Pune by claiming the wickets of Cheteshwar Pujara and Kohli in quick succession in the first innings before left-arm spinner Steve O'Keefe took charge. \nAustralia bowled out India for paltry totals of 105 and 107 in the two innings, with O'Keefe taking a total of 12 wickets as the visitors wrapped up a 333-run win inside three days. \nKohli, who has been in red-hot form in recent months, had a rare failure with scores of 0 and 13 in his two outings. \nBCCL \nAlso Read: Great Honour For Virat Kohli As World's Leading Cricket Site Names Him The Best Captain Of 2016 \nGuilty of chasing Starc's wide delivery outside the off-stump, Kohli gave away a catch to Peter Handscomb at first slip and the batting soon fell apart on a sharply turning wicket. \n\"We know (Kohli) is going to be another key wicket for the rest of the series. There's six more times we've got to get him out to really cement this series,\" Starc told reporters. \n\"We know he'll come back bigger and stronger, but he's one I'll take over Pujara at the moment,\" Starc said when asked to rate the importance of his twin strikes in Pune. \nStarc and Kohli are former team-mates for the Indian Premier League (IPL) side Royal Challengers Bangalore, and the Australian is well aware of how dangerous the Indian skipper can be once he gets his eye in.

      "text": "Tech Ecommerce Sstorm aims to be a better alternative to Amazon’s Global Store, with zero import fees and taxes Flipboard “A lot of times, people don’t know what they want until you show it to them.”— Steve Jobs. Sstorm aims to help Indians ‘window shop’ interesting products from around the world and then ‘hit’ buy without having to pay import fees and taxes. While e-commerce players in India are going through tough times with ‘rightsizing’, the appeal of cross-border e-commerce is catching on and is currently estimated to account for more than 25 percent of total global e-commerce sales. In October 2016, Amazon launched Amazon Global Store in India. San Francisco-headquartered Wish is another player in this space, but currently does not ship to India. Meanwhile, Indian sellers have been leveraging platforms like Alibaba and international logistics players to ship their products globally. Shipping products globally comes at a price though — customers generally have to foot the bill for customs duties, import charges and taxes. \nA five-member cross-border team based out of India (Mumbai) and the US aims to change that though. Their website, Sstorm, claims to reimagine international shopping. The company website states their USP thus: \n$80 in the US, $80 at your doorstep. Starting up — Zero to One vs One to N L-R: Sahej Sethi, Armaan Gandhi, Ryan La Valle and Arzan Irani \nSstorm was founded by the team of Arman Gandhi, Anup Gandhi, Arzan Irani and Ryan LaValle. Arman came up with the idea for Sstorm as a pivot for his earlier startup Xyra Technologies, which made and sold consumer electronic devices. \nBased on his experience in the sector and the constant pace of global innovation, Arman realised that constantly innovating in the hardware space was tough, as that needed one to have deep pockets to keep up with global giants. Innovating and creating a product from scratch, or going from Zero to One , the philosophy outlined in Peter Thiel’s book , is tough. Arman further realised that going from One to N, or achieving growth, is also a big challenge. A lot of hardware startups and platforms find it difficult to expand in their local and foreign markets. So, Arman thought, \nWhy don’t we try and find innovative retailers from across the world and bring them to India. The next step was to create a way for companies to ship products to India without hassles like the bureaucracy and the need to create a bank account. \nThe aim was to bring to India niche products that are not available on more mainstream platforms like Amazon’s Global Store and offer them to consumers at a fair price. Arman and his team noted that most international shipping platforms charge custom duties, shipping fees and additional taxes on goods, which can sometimes add up to almost 60 percent of the product’s selling price. \nSo, Sstorm started out with the goal of eliminating this, and aims to provide products to customers at MRP, sans the additional shipping and duty charges. They bring down the cost of products by tying up with suppliers and also shipping products in bulk at regular cycles of 10-20 days. \nAfter being in private beta for a few months, Sstorm was officially launched in India in January this year. So, how does Sstorm work? \nCustomers need to sign up on the platform to view products listed on Sstorm. Like other e-commerce platforms, each product is accompanied by pictures, a product description and the final price. One additional detail included is about when the sale of a product ends. \nProduct link: Sstorm \nOnce a sale cycle for a product ends, Sstorm processes all the orders together and ships them in bulk, which helps them bring down the final cost. Because of this and the fact that some products are hand-made or made-to-order, shipping time generally takes about two to three weeks. \nSstorm’s current portfolio of products mainly includes fashion accessories, accessories for smartphones and laptops, and other small-sized items like power banks, kettles and WiFi routers. \nAccording to Arman, an RFID-blocking wallet and a plasmatic lighter were among their best selling products in January. While Sstorm declined to share their current order volumes, Arman noted that they currently average around 3,000 visitors to their website every day. Considering the fact that most of their products come under the premium category, with an average price of around Rs 5,600, Sstorm is happy with the current traction. Cash on Delivery and product curation \nArman notes that their beta testing phase helped them tweak and enhance their platform to suit the Indian audience. He says, \nIndian consumers are generally not used to seeing these kinds of premium products, and we noticed that many, initially, dropped off before placing orders. \nOn further investigation, Sstorm realised that customers weren’t too keen on paying online on a new platform. So, taking a page out of Flipkart’s playbook, Sstorm introduced cash on delivery for its orders, and claims to have seen an increase in conversions and sales. \nProduct link: Sstorm \nGetting the right sellers onboard and curating products in regular cycles is important for a smooth flow. Arman says that his team of five spends a few hours every day hunting down interesting products, reaching out to sellers, and responding to incoming requests to ensure a good churn rate. Sstorm also ensures that their sellers have international warranties for their products, to ensure that servicing in the destination country (India) is taken care of. \nBased on a mutual understanding with the seller and the contract, a product is generally replaced or retained after one cycle, which usually lasts for about a month. Future plans \nSstorm is currently bootstrapped, and Arman notes that they plan to work on their venture for about six months before stepping out in the market to raise external capital. The aim, for the moment, is to figure out what works and what doesn’t, and further streamline execution and gain more traction. \nWhile many of Sstorm’s current products seem to be from the US, Arman says that they have signed exclusive agreements with suppliers from Canada, Italy, France and many other countries, but aim to introduce their products on Sstorm slowly, in phases. \nArman says that while their strategy of forcing even ‘window shoppers’ to sign up on their platform to just view products can be considered counterintuitive, it is a good strategy in the long run, as it helps them better understand the browsing patterns of potential and existing customers clearly and onboard the right suppliers. \nSstorm is also toying with the idea of creating an influencer platform and hosting product giveaways to increase their reach and customer base. Arman shares that one of the ultimate goals in the long run is to bring down the monthly refresh cycle to a daily one, once they hit critical mass. He says, \nOur goal is to bring a new retailer onboard every day and have more frequent flash sales. \nWhile the current focus is on shipping global products to India and increasing their supplier base, while understanding what kind of products the Indian consumer wants, Arman admits that in the long term, they might do the reverse too — ship Indian products to a global audience. \nWebsite- Sstorm Calling all Bangalore startups!

      "text": "Starc not worried by pitch 1:06 Merv Hughes thinks there’s a solution to pitch doctoring in Test cricket March 2, 2017 6:07pm by James Matthey Source: news.com.au STEVE O’Keefe was man of the match in the first Test between Australia and India in Pune. No doubt he’d like to thank his right hand man in that game — the Pune pitch. \nThere’s been much said and written about the 22 yards of grass (well, dirt) the Pune curator dished up in the middle of the Maharashtra Cricket Association Stadium. Shane Warne described it as looking like “an eighth day pitch” before play had even started and the ball spun prodigiously from the opening overs. \nThe ICC officially reported the “poor” Pune pitch as being unacceptable for Test cricket . Hardly surprising given the match didn’t even last a full three days. \nDesigned to help India’s spinners, the move backfired when left-arm finger spinner O’Keefe proved too tough to handle for the hosts’ batsmen and he ended up with 12 wickets for the match. Australia’s willow wielders surprised the hosts with their ability to handle to foreign conditions, in particular Matt Renshaw (68) in the first innings and Steve Smith (109) in the second. \nReports out of India suggest BCCI management strongarmed the curator into preparing a rank turner for the series opener after he initially refused the same request from Indian team management . \nPart of Test cricket is adapting to different conditions and home sides taking advantage of pitches they’ve grown up playing on, but for most, the Pune pitch went too far. So far in fact former Australian fast bowler Merv Hughes believes it’s time neutral curators became the norm to stop such incidents from re-occurring in the future. \n“What they (India) normally do, they prepare a pretty good pitch and then two days out they get the wire brushes out and take all the grass off it so it’s virtually a dust bowl,” Hughes told Sportsday SA. \n“That didn’t work for them in the first Test, will they be game enough to do that in the second Test and rely on winning the toss? I’m not sure. \n“Hopefully we get a decent cricket wicket, and as we’ve got neutral umpires now, I reckon the ICC are going to have to move towards neutral curators so we get even wickets and it’s not relying on the toss of the coin to win the game.” Is that a cricket pitch or the surface of Mars? Source: AFP \nIt’s not a new theory, but it’s one you rarely hear. Often talk revolves around changes made to the toss (last year English County cricket got rid of the toss, giving the away captain the option of bowling first without flipping the coin), but rarely is bringing in neutral curators brought up. \nLogistically this would be difficult to implement. Imported curators wouldn’t know the conditions (the weather, the outfield and the wicket square) as well as locals so you’d expect teething problems to be significant. There’s also the issue of whether people would be prepared to relocate for such work (would a Sydneysider want to move to Karachi or Dubai?). \nPreference might then be given to those willing to move rather than to the best possible candidate, which is problematic. \nBut perhaps there wouldn’t be a problem with alleged pitch doctoring if curators were left to their own devices, free of the pressures of answering to the home side. \nIn 2014 former Australian captain Ian Chappell penned a column titled “The pitch belongs to the curator” . In it he insisted curators should have full control over what surface to prepare while players concentrated on what they get paid to do — play. \n“I’ve always believed that there should be a divide between players and groundsmen. Let the experts prepare the best pitch possible and then it’s up to the players to perform on that surface,” Chappell wrote. \n“In an ideal world that is how it should be throughout the cricket world. And the administrators should also keep their nose out of the pitch preparation process. However, that doesn’t always happen.” Steve O'Keefe certainly enjoyed what Pune had to offer. Source: AP \nNo, it doesn’t always happen. Pune showed us that. \nSo what can we expect to see in the second Test in Bangalore? The pitch looks much greener than what welcomed the teams in Pune, but the game doesn’t start until Saturday afternoon (AEDT) so there’s plenty of time for that to change. \nThe smart money is on India still relying on a dry track, but one that doesn’t deteriorate as much until much later in the match. \n“They roll out a wicket they think is going to suit them with Ashwin and Jadeja. They didn’t expect O’Keefe to have that big of an impact so they certainly can’t go to Bangalore in the next Test and roll out the same wicket,” Hughes said. \n“Here’s the quandary for them. If they roll out a greenish wicket and it’s a little bit hard, (Josh) Hazlewood and (Mitchell) Starc will take full toll of that. It’s going to be interesting to see what the wicket in the next Test match is.” What’s in store in Bangalore? Source: AP  ",

      "title": "The anti-Flipkart: Curated marketplace Qtrove’s discount-free, sustainability-driven billion-dollar global dreams",
      "text": "Flipboard \nProfitability-focused Qtrove offers non-mass produced products from small sellers in an attempt to free online shoppers from the ‘tyranny of choice’ \nSay you want to buy a dress. You don’t have a brand, style or colour in mind, and decide to check out Flipkart or Amazon. How do you choose from the thousands of options that these marketplaces unleash upon you? Unless you chance upon a piece of clothing you fall in love with at first sight, trying to choose will make your head spin. And when it is a utility product like a pen drive, how do you pick one over the other? The price and the brand become the only differentiators. Tyranny of choice – this sums up the experience of many e-commerce consumers. \nIs this the only way to shop? No, say Vinamra Pandiya and Prashanth Nagarajan, Co-founders of barely year-old Qtrove. The Bengaluru-based startup was launched with an anti-e-commerce strategy. Says Vinamra, \nWe are anti-ecommerce. E-commerce is a dictatorship. There is no differentiation, only discounts. E-commerce sites buy transactions, not customers. The products are mass produced, and whichever site offers better rates gets the customer. They want the customer to come, buy and get out, and not spend time on the site. We want to build a marketplace where the products, sellers and customers are celebrated. We want our customers to stay on the site and engage with us. Our products are not mass produced - they are mostly natural and sustainable. My sellers might be small, but they make unique products. We are freeing customers from the tyranny of choice.” Prashanth Nagarajan (L) and Vinamra Pandiya, founders of curated marketplace Qtrove A different path \nThat’s an impressive manifesto, and the idea did not come to Vinamra overnight. An IIT-BHU graduate, Vinamra became a foodtech entrepreneur with Mom’s Kitchen, an online startup that served food from its centralised kitchens in Pune . The company saw turnover grow to Rs 75 lakh per annum, but could not raise further funding due to the recession of 2008, and eventually shut down. Vinamra then joined food delivery startup TastyKhana in 2009 as its Chief Operating Officer, and moved to Foodpanda in 2015 when the former got acquired. However, the now well-publicised issues at Foodpanda led Vinamra to leave the company a few months later. \nAfter almost a decade in Pune and in foodtech, Vinamra was at a crossroads. He knew he wanted to start up again, and this time, he wanted to do that in Bengaluru – India’s startup capital. He had an idea to do a curated food marketplace, and in late-2015, Vinamra got in touch with serial entrepreneur K. Ganesh of GrowthStory , a startup incubator. During his discussions with Ganesh, the original idea evolved into that of a curated marketplace for all categories. Vinamra met co-founder Prashanth, who was then managing operations for the South for Grofers, through GrowthStory. \nWith GrowthStory backing them, the duo met potential sellers to understand their views. The type of sellers Vinamra and Prashanth were looking for were typically small merchants and entrepreneurs making mostly unique or handcrafted products. Those who were on bigger marketplaces were unhappy as they felt lost among the large sellers. In July, the company soft-launched the site, mainly for family and friends to try out and give feedback. By November, satisfied with the feedback and with the processes in place, Qtrove began marketing and reaching out to a wider audience. Small is big \nQtrove, which stands for curated trove, today offers about 5,000 products from 200 sellers across 40 categories. The platform is a pure marketplace, with Qtrove not holding any stock. It is, however, a closed marketplace, with the team doing background checks on sellers and quality checks of products before approving listings. “The focus is not on having a large number of products, but on curation. We have internal quality guidelines for every type of product, for example what exactly is handmade chocolate,” says Vinamra. The startup supports sellers by connecting them with logistics providers and doing all product shoots. “When Airbnb started, Craigslist was already present. The difference was the beautiful photos. To build trust, good photos that reflect the product are required. So we give a lot of importance to photographing the products,” says the 35-year-old. \nThe products are all non-mass produced and are mostly natural and hand crafted, and include items like sourdough breads, upcycled clothes and all-natural cosmetics. Ganesh of GrowthStory says Qtrove is mainly about discovery. He says: \nIt is not meant for the large manufacturers. If you are a Tirupur-based t-shirt manufacturer, your best bet is Myntra. But if you are a small player making hand painted t-shirts, then Qtrove is a better bet.” \nAnother decision the founders took early on was to focus on a no-discount model. About 70 percent of sales on the site happen without any discounts. “But the seller can discount if he wants, and if he wants to increase the price, he can do that too. It’s all up to him,” says Ganesh. \nSmall scale sellers on the site are obviously happy. Durga Menon, founder of seven-year-old Luuvia Bakery, was the first vendor to list on the site, as Prashanth was a regular customer. She makes artisanal breads from a small unit that employs 10 women. “I spend all my time in the bakery, and have no time for marketing. I am happy to be on the site as they understand food. They ensure that they get the right product descriptions from me, take appealing photographs of my breads and cakes, and enable customers to find us easily on the site,” says Durga, a former techie who returned to India after over a decade in the US. She says that while sales through the site are still only a fraction of her overall sales of Rs 3 lakh, she expects it to grow. The right customer \nWhile sellers are happy, what about customers, especially since online shoppers are used to being pampered with discounts? Vinamra admits that the concept will not appeal to all. “But awareness regarding the problems with mass produced products is growing. The market for the kind of products we sell is growing, and in a few years, it will be big,” says Vinamra, who claims a customer base of over 10,000, order volumes of 500 shipments a day, and an average order size of around Rs 600. \nA handful of online startups offer curated or unique products in various categories, especially in furniture and home décor, like Zufolo, The Décor Kart, Bent Chai, Pinklay and Wishing Chair. Multi-category marketplaces, meanwhile, are fewer in number, with players like Jaypore, Natty and Love This Stuff in the space. While it is difficult to calculate the extent of the market for non-mass produced or handcrafted products, the market size for organic food is a good indicator. A study by industry body Assocham and non-government organisation TechSci Research estimated that the market for organic food is currently at $500 million, and will grow by three times in the next four years. Etsy, a US-based marketplace for handcrafted goods, is a listed entity with a market cap of almost $1.5 billion. \nGanesh says a company like Qtrove will be much smaller than a Flipkart or Amazon in terms of GMV. He adds: \nWe are not in the space of daily basic needs or even high GMV items like LED TVs. You will not come to us for that. The same customer who buys a TV on Flipkart also buys handcrafted, personalised or limited volume products for certain needs. If he wants preservative-free honey, he will come to Qtrove.\" \nQtrove is experimenting with its marketing to ensure that it reaches the right audience without breaking the bank. It runs Facebook and Google ads showcasing products and messaging tailored to each audience, like singles or families with kids. “I don’t want to spend crores on marketing as that would bring discount-focused customers. Our customer acquisition rate is lower, but we get the right audience,” says Vinamra. \nThis frugality in marketing spend is reflected in cost areas too. The company continues to have a lean team, with an employee base of 10. The idea is to throw technology at a problem and not people, and hence, they have automated functions like invoice generation and sending emailers. “I am creating systems now that can manage 10,000 orders a day,” says Vinamra, who is looking to reach 1,000 orders a day in three months. The company, which charges a commission of 25 to 30 percent from sellers, is unit positive already, and is targeting operational profitability by year-end. \nWhile growing the number of products, sellers and orders is part of the game plan, the focus is on quality, and not on growth at any cost. The idea is to increase revenue per seller, increase repeat purchase rate, and make each sale profitable. The company has also diversified into corporate and event gifting, and intends to eventually go global. It has already done a few international offline bulk deals. Vinamra says: \nWe want to become a multi-billion dollar global entity without raising billions in capital.\" \nWebsite Calling all Bangalore startups!

Photograph: Yui Mok/PA View more sharing options   12.22 GMT Last modified on   12.36 GMT \nTaxi drivers and business leaders have added their voices to the growing campaign calling on ministers to introduce a diesel scrappage scheme to tackle dangerous levels of air pollution. \nA broad alliance of business organisations and environmental charities has written to the chancellor, Philip Hammond, urging him to introduce a system in next week’s budget to compensate motorists switching from diesel to more environmentally friendly vehicles. City of burning lakes: experts fear Bangalore will be uninhabitable by 2025 Read more \nSenior MPs, environmental groups and senior doctors are part of the coalition who say a scrappage scheme is essential if the government is to tackle the air pollution crisis affecting many towns and cities in the UK. \nThe letter – signed by organisations including the Federation of Small Businesses, London First, Greenpeace and the Licensed Taxi Drivers Association (LTDA) – supports proposals put forward by the mayor of London, Sadiq Khan , for a national diesel scrappage fund that he argues would financially compensate motorists and enable the government to get a grip on illegal levels of toxic air. \nIt states: “We believe the mayor has adopted a cost-effective approach that minimises risks and simplifies administration for government.” \nIt says Khan’s proposals “rebalance the financial cost of improving our air away from the individual – unlocking significant emission reductions while reducing the cost for those least able to afford to upgrade their vehicle or change how they drive”. \nAir pollution causes 40,000 early deaths in the UK and costs the country £27.5bn a year, according to a government estimate. MPs have called it a public health emergency. \nOn Saturday the Guardian revealed that tens of thousands of children and young people at more than 800 nurseries, schools and colleges in London faced dangerous and illegal levels of toxic air , much of it caused by diesel cars. Check if your London nursery, school or college is exposed to toxic air Read more \nThe transport secretary, Chris Grayling, indicated the government might bow to pressure , saying motorists should be wary of buying diesel cars, adding: “We’re going to have to really migrate our car fleet, and our vehicle fleet more generally, to cleaner technology.” However, he said that diesel “was not going to disappear”. \nUnder Khan’s proposals, which can be adapted for other UK cities, there would be: Payments of £3,500 to scrap up to 70,000 polluting vans and minibuses in London and a national fund to support charities and small businesses that often own older diesel vans and minibuses. A credit scheme valued at £2,000 to help low-income households in cities scrap up to 130,000 polluting cars, with incentives for car clubs and public transport. Payments of £1,000 to help scrap up to 10,000 older polluting London taxis (in addition to extra Transport for London help for drivers to upgrade to greener taxis). \nPaul Morozzo, from Greenpeace, backed the plans, saying it was now clear diesel fumes were “toxic to human health”. \n“A scrappage fund is one of the niftiest ways to get dirty diesels off our roads. And for maximum take-up it should offer credits for car sharing or public transport, as a lower-cost alternative to buying a brand-new cleaner car under the scheme.” \nSteve McNamara, the general secretary at the LTDA, said cab drivers were committed to tackling the decline in the capital’s air quality. \nHe said: “We fully support the mayor’s proposals for a national vehicle scrappage fund, which will make it fairer and easier for drivers to meet the cost associated with decommissioning the oldest, most polluting vehicles, helping us to become the greenest cab fleet of any city in the world.”",

      "text": "AHMEDABAD/RAJKOT: The two Islamic State terror group suspects arrested from Rajkot and Bhavnagar on Sunday have confessed to their plans of planting bombs in the thickly populated Trikon Baug and Gundawadi areas of Rajkot this week. \n\nOn Monday , the suspects Waseem Ramodiya and his brother Naeem were remanded to the custody of the Anti-Terrorist Squad (ATS) till March 10. Investigators have got names of at least 40 other persons from across Gujarat, including Ahmedabad, who were engaged with the brothers regarding IS activities across the globe. \n\n\"We are conducting verification of these persons to know the extent of their indoctrination,\" an official said. \n\nDuring questioning, Waseem told the ATS that his wife Shahzeen used to frequently taunt him as \"impotent\" for not being able to execute the \"tasks\" given to him by their handlers who operated with the names \"Big Cat\" and \"onegoal1aim\" through the username @katakat313. The handlers, suspected to be Indians , were communicating with Waseem through a social media platform in an end-to-end encrypted code. \n\nATS officials told TOI that Shahzeen's taunts got on to Waseem's nerves and he finally went to Chotila on January 15. However, he stopped 10km away from the town, fearing that he would be caught. The brothers then decided to torch vehicles in Bhavnagar. \"However, they again feared getting caught and did not set the vehicles ablaze,\" said an investigator. \n\nThen, as per the handlers' instructions, the duo gathered fire crackers from Rajkot's Sadar Bazaar and a nine-volt battery to assemble IEDs. The IEDs were to be planted at Trikon Baug and Gundawadi on the week ending March 4. \n\n\"We are verifying the evidence against Shahzeen before taking any action,\" the official said. Officials also said the PDF files the brothers downloaded had details about lone wolf attack at a Bangalore-based restaurant by Alamzeb Afridi, an Indian Mujahideen suspect. Meanwhile, the Rajkot Bar Association adopted a resolution not to defend Waseem and Naeem. \n\nDawood's brother threatens bizman \n\nGujarat police officers said that Safdar Khatri, nephew of Jamnagar businessman Ashfaq Khatri, emailed a complaint to a central agency along with the Pakistan contact number of Anees Ibrahim, who works for Dawood Ibrahim's gang. Ashfaq had introduced a tobacco product (`Hot') in Dubai due to which Anees's business took a beating. Safdar said he was being threatened by a Dawood gang member to get him to enter a partnership with them. \n ",

      "text": "No band and no baaja: When Indian weddings were legally required to be austere The Indian government wants to curb big fat weddings – but it has already been there, done that. Print \nOn a cool December day in 1965, 25 people assembled at Shyama Kulkarni’s parents’ house at Peddar Road inBombay. The Vardes were hosting a lunch for the family following their daughter’s wedding the previous day, and precisely 25 plates of food were being readied. “There was no 26th person allowed,” remembered Kulkarni, a civic activist, 51 years later. “My father had said, I am not going to break any rules.” \nIt was a few months after the India-Pakistan War and a year after Prime Minister Lal Bahadur Shastri came to power, bringing with him exhortations of self-control and food rationing. \nThe rules of the day forbade a host from serving more than 25 people at home. In any case, the national mood following the war was one of austerity and citizens like the Vardes were acutely conscious of expenditure and food shortages. They also knew people who had died in the war. \n“It was not a time to celebrate,” Kulkarni said. “We felt we shouldn’t spend unnecessarily.” \nThe wedding took place in a temple in the early evening, followed by a reception where guests were served a few snacks, because serving certain kinds of foodgrain to more than a specified number was prohibited. “Maybe each person got 10 or 12 wafers,” said Padma Varde, Kulkarni’s sister, laughing. Even as the sister of the bride she couldn’t attend the lunch at home. “It was very spartan. We took it very seriously.” Her father gave her some money and along with other relatives of the bride she had lunch at a restaurant to avoid violating the 25-person ceiling. Food inspection raj \nHalf a century on, in mid-February, a Bill was introduced in the Lok Sabha seeking to limit expenditures on lavish weddings, proposing that those with a Rs 5 lakh-plus budget contribute to a welfare fund – it also empowers the government to specify guest numbers or items served to avoid food wastage. The same month, the Jammu and Kashmir went ahead and announced that beginning April 1 it will curb guest numbers and dishes at weddings in the state. \nThese moves are a throwback to an era of muted celebrations – an era that bore the stamp of Nehruvian statism and the civic obligation to exercise self-control at weddings and parties. \nPrime Minister Lal Bahadur Shastri, under whom the food inspection raj was enjoying a fine moment, set the tone in a speech : \n“Parties, dinners and lunches are not in tune with the times at all. At weddings, there should be no exhibition of ostentation. There is no need for many dishes to be served. Hotels and restaurants also have to keep in line with present day requirements. Austerity is the need of the hour and it must be encouraged by strong public opinion.” \nThe legacy of Second World War rationing still lingered, and in a newly-independent India, the Essential Commodities Act, 1955, was introduced to control the supply and distribution of food items. It spawned a series of orders to check the movement of commodities and carefully control their distribution and prices – prohibited food items like cereals and pulses, for instance, couldn’t be fed to more than a certain number of guests andthe strictures applied to hosts, hoteliers and caterers. The best known of these were the Delhi Guest Control Orders of 1968, 1972 and 1976, but the proclivity for tamping down on celebrations found echoes in state orders in Assam, Andhra Pradesh and Rajasthan, among others. \n“...these Control Orders were a definitive feature of the 1960s food regime with its pillars of austerity, agricultural productivity and rationing controls,” writes the scholar Tarangini Sriraman in a paper on rationing and License Raj-era officialdom. “These Control Orders while they sought to regulate parties of all kinds – official parties, funeral parties and festival parties – were however mainly aimed at the opulent displays and lavish hospitality of Indian weddings and more than anything else, the wonton cooking and consumption of rationed items and the unrestrained social impulse to invite hundreds of guests.” \nIn Calcutta, every wedding card in the mid-seventiescame with a line of fine print, stating that the government Guest Control Order would be followed. “People more or less followed the rules,” said Malabika Ghosh, a retired college teacher. “In case there were raids, people were scared to defy the rules.” At Ghosh’s wedding in December 1974, there was no pulao because of rice rationing – instead, she remembers, they served a replacement, possibly dalia . \nWe might never know how many weddings ended with ignominious raid scenes, but that rules existed on paper was enough to give one pause. Vivek Agnihotri was a young district revenue officer at the time in Andhra Pradesh, and part of his official mandate was implementing the restrictions – except, it wasn’t exactly possible to do so. “There was no way to send someone and check how many people were attending a wedding or whether to raid a function,” he said. “We had more serious things to do.” In his three years in that district, Agnihotri never busted a marriage party. The aftertaste of austerity hung in the air through the 1970s, when the Bhides got married. \nThe Delhi Guest Control (Third Amendment) Order issued in 1977, the year the Emergency ended, raised the number of guests at ordinary parties to 50 and for weddings and funerals to 100. Though the orders might have been implemented unevenly and modified to allow more indulgences over time, the aftertaste of austerity hung in the air through the 1970s and beyond. \nIn October 1978, the Bhides booked a wedding hall for a single day in Bombay where all three functions took place and cancelled the outdoor celebrations when it threatened to rain. There was lunch for relatives before the ceremony, and chai and ice cream for the 200 or 300 people who came in the evening. “I don’t remember the flavour,” said Sujata Bhide, the bride. “But it was definitely not cassata. That was a big shot item and only the posh people served that.” \nA lot of ice cream appears to have been consumed through the 1970s at weddings in Bombay, likely a throwback to the rule forbidding pulses or grain being served. \n“This was normal everywhere,” said Bhide, “It didn’t feel odd. You’d go just to eat ice cream. No one expected dinner. They would go back home and eat.” \nAt the Bhides’ wedding, a neighbour, an amateur photographer, served to take the official photos at the wedding, all in black and white. A single Polaroid photo taken with an America-based cousin’s camera was the exclusive colour indulgence in the album. A single Polaroid photo was the only colour indulgence in the Bhides' wedding album. \nSimilar minimalism prevailed down south in Bangalore. \nIn a faded colour photo, V Ramkumar can be seen standing seriously, his grey bell bottoms hanging over his six foot frame. That photograph, from his wedding day on June 8, 1979, screams of the decade. Elsewhere in the album, his wife Vani is draped in a Rs 150 blue sari bought five years previously and diamond earrings worth Rs 5,000. “I made such a fuss about the earrings,” she recalled. “I cried at the shop. I just didn’t want to dress up or spend any money for my wedding.” \nAt the doctor couple’s wedding the presents too were of a very 1970s vintage: alarm clocks and milk cookers,a retro device for boiling milk. “We got about 10 alarm clocks and seven cookers,” said Ramkumar, laughing. “Those were the common gifts of the time.” \nCash gifts ranged from Rs 7 at the lower end to a few hundreds at the higher end. The average hovered somewhere around Rs 31. \nA week after the wedding, Vani’s parents held a small garden party at their home in Dehradun. Guests were served tea, ice cream and a savoury, recalls her mother, Vishu Guha, who hosted the do. Each plate cost Rs 7, and an army band played for free. V Ramkumar (in bell bottoms) and his wife Vani received about 10 alarm clocks as wedding presents. \nThe Bhides and Ramkumars had relatively simple weddings compared to the razzle-dazzle that has become a staple since the turn of the century. But when Vibhuti Patel married Amar Jesani in October 1977, it was not just simple, it was austerity taken to its logical conclusion for the two activists, both of whom were deeply engaged in the social movements of the time. The total cost they incurred: Rs 20 for the revenue stamp to officially solemnise the union. \nIn the months just after the Emergency, Patel, now an economics professor and then a PhD student from Bombay, went to Baroda where Jesani was studying for his MBBS. Taking a 15-minute break from a trade union protest, Jesani rode his cycle to the nearby court. He brought along three friends to stand in as witnesses. No one else came. “Having a simple wedding was a conscious choice,” she said. “The marriages of those around us were also like this.” In ordinary clothes and with no ornaments, Patel was also taking a political stance. \n“Because of the menace of dowry I had taken a pledge when I was very small that I would never touch gold,” she said. (As it happens, the dowry problem was another reason weddings were sought to be regulated in the past.) Since Patel is Hindu and her husband Muslim, there was the additional complication of the union being taboo in the eyes of many.

In 1978, a magistrate in Rajasthan imposed a fine on a family for violating the local law and hosting 200 people. Authorities seized “2 quintals and 80 kg of prepared malpuas, 5 kg of the mixture of flour and gur used for preparation of malpuas; 40 kg. of boiled potatoes and 20 kg of wheat flour” per the court order . The magistrate observed at the time that “the practice of giving a feast on the occasion of marriage or death might be an offence in the eye of law but it is a source of happiness in the life of our people in the village”. The higher court disagreed, but no further punishment was imposed. By the mid-1970s, the seriousness of rationing orders already seemed to have been receding. \n“We were vaguely conscious of some rules,” said Rajashri Dasgupta, a Kolkata-based journalist who got married in May 1978 in Allahabad. “By the seventies food rationing had eased off but the culture of not having elaborate functions still remained.” This was great for Dasgupta and her husband who wanted a small, family affair. Only 30 people stayed for dinner, though about 150 people came to meet the couple before that and were given packets of namkeen and a sweet. “People seemed happy,” she said. “They accepted it as the culture of the time.” V Ramkumar and Vani in their wedding finery.

      "title": "How Horizon: Zero Dawn accidentally became 2017’s most important game",
      "text": "Horizon: Zero Dawn is supposed to be a fantasy game, and with its tale of huge robotic monsters roaming around a lush but post-apocalyptic landscape, it looks like one too. But after the year we’ve had, it can feel a little too close for comfort.\nIt wasn’t meant to be this way. When the game began, it started as a fun way of exploring an interesting environment – but by centring around the concerns of environmentalism, automation and feminism, it seems to have ended up as 2017’s most important game.\nHorizon: Zero Dawn entered an entirely different world when it was fist pitched in 2010. In fact, it was mostly conceived of as a way of getting away from the kind of bleak horror of Killzone, the franchise that developer Guerrilla Games was previously famous for.\nGadgets and tech news in pictures 44 show all Gadgets and tech news in pictures 1/44 A humanoid robot gestures during a demo at a stall in the Indian Machine Tools Expo, IMTEX/Tooltech 2017 held in Bangalore\nGetty Images\n2/44 A humanoid robot gestures during a demo at a stall in the Indian Machine Tools Expo, IMTEX/Tooltech 2017 held in Bangalore\nGetty Images\n3/44 A humanoid robot gestures during a demo at a stall in the Indian Machine Tools Expo, IMTEX/Tooltech 2017 held in Bangalore\nGetty Images\n4/44 Engineers test a four-metre-tall humanoid manned robot dubbed Method-2 in a lab of the Hankook Mirae Technology in Gunpo, south of Seoul, South Korea\nJung Yeon-Je/AFP/Getty Images\n5/44 Engineers test a four-metre-tall humanoid manned robot dubbed Method-2 in a lab of the Hankook Mirae Technology in Gunpo, south of Seoul, South Korea\nJung Yeon-Je/AFP/Getty Images\n6/44 The giant human-like robot bears a striking resemblance to the military robots starring in the movie 'Avatar' and is claimed as a world first by its creators from a South Korean robotic company\nJung Yeon-Je/AFP/Getty Images\n7/44 Engineers test a four-metre-tall humanoid manned robot dubbed Method-2 in a lab of the Hankook Mirae Technology in Gunpo, south of Seoul, South Korea\nJung Yeon-Je/AFP/Getty Images\n8/44 Waseda University's saxophonist robot WAS-5, developed by professor Atsuo Takanishi\nRex\n9/44 Waseda University's saxophonist robot WAS-5, developed by professor Atsuo Takanishi and Kaptain Rock playing one string light saber guitar perform jam session\nRex\n10/44 A test line of a new energy suspension railway resembling the giant panda is seen in Chengdu, Sichuan Province, China\nReuters\n11/44 A test line of a new energy suspension railway, resembling a giant panda, is seen in Chengdu, Sichuan Province, China\nReuters\n12/44 A concept car by Trumpchi from GAC Group is shown at the International Automobile Exhibition in Guangzhou, China\nRex\n13/44 A Mirai fuel cell vehicle by Toyota is displayed at the International Automobile Exhibition in Guangzhou, China \nReuters\n14/44 A visitor tries a Nissan VR experience at the International Automobile Exhibition in Guangzhou, China\nReuters\n15/44 A man looks at an exhibit entitled 'Mimus' a giant industrial robot which has been reprogrammed to interact with humans during a photocall at the new Design Museum in South Kensington, London\nGetty\n16/44 A new Israeli Da-Vinci unmanned aerial vehicle manufactured by Elbit Systems is displayed during the 4th International conference on Home Land Security and Cyber in the Israeli coastal city of Tel Aviv\nGetty\n17/44 Electrification Guru Dr. Wolfgang Ziebart talks about the electric Jaguar I-PACE concept SUV before it was unveiled before the Los Angeles Auto Show in Los Angeles, California, U.S\nReuters\n18/44 The Jaguar I-PACE Concept car is the start of a new era for Jaguar.

As well as being set in an entirely different world – Killzone depicted the life of a footsoldier in a hellish warring environment, where Horizon mostly centres around a relatively lonely individual in a huge lush expanse – it brought with it technical challenges, like it being the developer’s first role playing game, and being set in a huge expansive world where Guerrilla is used to orienting games around scenarios.\nBut at the centre of that game – and keeping all that huge world in check – is Aloy. It should be surprising that the developers opted to have a female main character and not force her to be sexualised or helpless, but it is.\nOnce again, Mr Sharma says that the developers accidentally stumbled into a character that embodied the game’s depiction of a world not lived in the patriarchy. It might feel like an exciting fantasy in these tough times – but it wasn’t supposed to be.\n“Aloy was always part of the initial pitch when we made the game,” he says. “We wanted a vulnerable character who is capable but almost constantly in incredible danger.”\nThe character lives in a world inhabited by huge and terrifying machines – one that resembles our Earth but is different in significant and scary ways.\n“These machines run the world and humanity is no longer the dominant species,” says Mr Sharma. “It turns out her quest for finding out who she is and where she comes from dovetails nicely with the player wanting to discover what this world is about and what is going on and why these machines exist.”\nThat was the main focus – not whether Aloy looked the right way or if she would suit the kinds of imaginary teenage boy that some developers continue to make their games for.\n“It never crossed our minds that it would be a question as to why a female character,” says Mr Sharma, expressing a kind of excited shock that anyone would even wonder how it could happen. “We’re always caught by surprise.\n“The decision to not sexualise her was also a no-brainer. We’re not that sort of studio, the decision was to make a character that told a story in a way that was organic.\n“The world is harsh and beautiful. It leads itself to a sort of person who can be capable.”\nWith that character, as with all of the game, Guerrilla didn’t intend to make a statement; the statement was made for it, as the world moves towards the game.\n“Given the world as it is at the moment wasn’t our reality six years ago, back in 2011 and 2010,” when the game’s pitching process began, Mr Sharma says. “So in reality we hadn’t thought of the conversations people would draw once the game was done.\n“But it was a long process making the game. Whilst we were making the game the world changed. So now there are those questions, but it wasn’t our intent to make a statement.” \nStill, for all his company’s prescience, Mr Sharma is keen to stress that there are universal concerns at the game’s core. Everything might seem a little topical – but the game worries about things that are as true now as they were six years ago when the game started being developed, and probably were true for thousands of years before that.\n“There is something about a vulnerable yet strong character who has an incredible amount of empathy for everyone around her and wants to help them, even in the face of giant machine monsters,” says Mr Sharma. “There’s something universal about that, that doesn’t change with time.\n“We’re quite proud of being able to tell that story, of resilience in the face of overwhelming odds. You don’t need to lose your empathy and love just to beat the odds.”\nIf there is a message for today’s mixed-up and often confusing world, though, Mr Sharma hopes that it can be one of faith and optimism about what comes after, not of despair about what might happen before we get there. Even in the desolate destruction of the post-apocalyptic world, the game’s colours are bright and lush, and its world is thrilling – even as huge killer robots stalk the earth, some hope grows.",

      "text": "Photo credit: ververidis / 123RF. \nHiring is the ultimate make-or-break decision for any company, and recruiters are always hunting for ways to crack it. SaaS startup Belong, which takes a shot at it with predictive analytics, just got a boost from Sequoia Capital India as well as its earlier investors Matrix Partners India. That’s not all.\nRide-hailing app Ola gets a fresh lease of life, a shared accommodation startup gets backing right after the shutdown of India’s biggest homestay network, and an emotional wellness app rounded up another day in the life of Indian startups.\nBelong Belong , which uses predictive analytics for hiring, today announced series B funding of US$10 million led by Sequoia Capital India, with participation from existing investor Matrix Partners India. Gautam Mago, Sequoia Capital India Advisors MD, has joined the Belong board of directors, which includes Tarun Davda, Matrix Partners India MD, and Raju Reddy, founder of Sierra Atlantic.\nThree-year-old Belong counts Cisco, Amazon, Tesco, Reliance Jio, and ThoughtWorks among clients for its SaaS (software-as-a-service) product. “In today’s candidate-centric market, I’d say data-driven outbound hiring is clearly the most intelligent and scientific way to scale recruiting,” says Savita Hortikar, who heads talent acquisition in India for ThoughtWorks.\nSee: Your angry reactions to Donald Trump’s Facebook posts might help you get a job \nOla Photo credit: Michael Coghlan .\nUber’s Indian rival Ola got a fresh lease of life with US$330 million from its lead investor, Japan’s SoftBank. But it was a down round as Ola was reported to have been valued at US$3.5 billion, against its valuation of US$5 billion in the last funding round in 2015. SoftBank wrote down its investment in Ola last year.\nBoth Uber and Ola have got hit with strikes in recent weeks. Drivers unhappy with a cutback on incentives. The ride-hailing apps as well as the leading ecommerce marketplaces Amazon and Flipkart have tried discounts and incentives to gain an upper hand in the Indian market.\nSee: Meru strikes while the iron is hot, even as Uber and Ola are in limbo \nStayAbode StayAbode team.

Typically it offers a bed and cupboard as private space, and shared spaces like kitchen and living room. It serves the needs of those who don’t want the hassle of maintaining an apartment.\nToday it announced angel funding of an undisclosed amount led by Ishan Manaktala and Angie Mahtaney. A group of Investors from online funding platform LetsVenture participated in the round. Stayabode is co-founded by Viral Chhajer, Varun Bhalla, and Devashish Dalmiya who previously worked at startups Runnr, Treebo Hotels, and Roadhouse Hostels.\nSee: India’s largest homestay startup Stayzilla shuts down \nTouchkin Emotional wellness AI chatbot Wysa.

      "text": "He's just 24-years-old, but he is already being hailed as the new king of Indian classical music. It's refreshing when an honest Ambi Subramaniam admits that it feels great to hear such things, but is quick to add that his family ' music maestro father L Subramaniam and singer mother Kavita Krishnamurti Subramaniam ' help keep him grounded. The young musician has his hands full, what with releasing his solo album, travelling the world with his parents, releasing singles with his sister for their band SubraMania and doing his bit for the Subramaniam Academy of Performing Arts (SaPa). In the midst of all this, Ambi took time out to speak to Bangalore Times about all this and more'\nYou are being called the new king of Indian classical music. And this title comes at the age of just 24'\nIt feels great to hear such things. A person gets into music for the love of it, and all these things are bonuses. Although it feels really good to hear these things, you shouldn't be working for it; you can't focus too much on such external things. There are many talented kids aged 13 and 14, but they kind of just stay there. Luckily, I have two parents who have walked the path, and they are also grounded, so they help me be that.\nYour second album, Just Playing, that released recently, comes three years after the first. Why the long wait?\nAfter the first album, Indian Violin, I wanted to make another album when I was significantly better. I didn't want to just keep bringing out albums unless I had something better to say. This album is different; in the first one, I went into the studio and played whatever I felt like, but the second one was more planned. The idea in this one was to take difficult pieces and make them sound simple.\nHow does one make difficult pieces sound simple?\nThe structure is complex in some of the pieces and the scales are challenging to improvize, which is why people normally don't do it ' they just play the piece. I wanted to work on those intricate scales. Musicians will realize the difficulty of the scales, but even if you are just a listener, you should still be able to find it appealing. In that sense, I was trying to simplify it in a way that the general audience shouldn't know if it is a difficult or easy piece.\nSo, your music will appeal even to those who have never heard Indian classical music before?\nComplexity shouldn't be a factor in music. If you know the raaga and taala, great, but if you don't, it shouldn't matter, as good music should appeal to everyone. Music should be able to connect emotionally, whether you know music or not.\nYou have your solo projects, you tour the world, play with your parents, have a band with your sister and teach at SaPa. How do you prioritize everything?\n(Laughs) Good question. It changes from day to day. I'm lucky that I get to do different things, which is why my life is never boring. All the things that I am doing are related to music and each of them kind of helps the other. Whether I am playing a classical concert or making music for SubraMania, it helps the other. Many of my collaborations have helped my music and that goes into teaching at SaPa.\nWhat can we look forward to from you in the near future?\nApart from touring, Bindu and I are releasing another single in a couple of weeks. It is a piece that we composed for a flamenco guitarist when we toured Spain . Apart from that, we started a TV show recently for SaPa to promote kids in a non-competitive environment. In a way, it's an answer to reality shows. The idea is to teach music to very young children who have no exposure and get great artistes to come on the show and talk about different kinds of instruments. Reality shows put too much pressure on kids; children are at the top of their game when they are eight, and by the time they are nine, the next kid comes in. Where do they go from there? So, the idea of our show is not to create eight-year-old prodigies, but to have good musicians even at the age of 25; basically, create sustained musical growth.",

      "text": "Cricket Can Virat Kohli do now what Sourav Ganguly did in 2001? Virat Kohli and Team India had a rare failure in Pune but they will look at their predecessors for inspiration ahead of the second Test vs Australia. Kohli will be eager to bounce back after India's crushing defeat to Australia 2 He scored 0 and 13 in the Pune Test 3 He can draw inspiration from Ganguly, who led India to a historic series victory back in 2001 \nVirat Kohli will be eager to bounce back after India's crushing 333-run defeat to Australia in Pune. Kohli, who has been in the middle of a sensational run of form, scored 0 and 13 as Australia steamrolled the world's number one Test team in less than three days. \nCLICK TO WATCH VIDEO \nHowever, Kohli can draw inspiration from Sourav Ganguly, who led India to a historic series victory over the world-beating Australians back in 2001. Sixteen years ago, India were similarly under pressure at home, having lost the opening Test in Mumbai. But then, an unheralded VVS Laxman and a young Harbhajan Singh turned the table for the hosts, who went on win in Kolkata and Mumbai. \nKohli, by contrast, has a far more settled team. Both his spinners - R Ashwin and Ravindra Jadeja are on top of the ICC rankings for bowlers. His pacers, led by Umesh Yadav, have bowled manfully while the batsmen, barring one or two exceptions, are in good form. ( Exclusive: Sourav Ganguly recalls 2001 miracle vs Australia at Eden Gardens ) \nMurali Vijay scored two hundreds against England and another against Bangladesh at the top of the order while Cheteshwar Pujara has been rock-solid, scoring runs against New Zealand, England and Bangladesh. \nKohli of course has been leading the pack with some breathtaking performances. He became the only batsman to slam double hundreds in four successive series before his first duck at home in Test cricket. ( Can Virat Kohli's India repeat 2001 heroics vs Australia? Harbhajan Singh and Nayan Mongia recall Kolkata miracle ) \nWhile Kohli's failure was perhas due given his staggering loss, it was the margin of defeat that hurt all stakeholders in Indian cricket. \nFormer cricketers were pained at the manner of capitulation. India were blown away for 105 and 107 and did not even last 80 overs in both innings combined. \nIn short, Australia, outbowled, outbatted and outfielded India in conditions that were tailor-made for the hosts. The pitch turned square from day one and it was the Australins who dominated Kohli's men. \nThe pitch turned from day one but it was Steve O'Keefe who took more wickets than Ashwin and Jadeja combined. The pitch turned from day but it was Nathan Lyon who looked more dangerous than Ashwin. ( Why Australia's spinners won't threaten India again in this series ) \nBut India can overcome that stutter in Pune and hit back hard in Bangalore, just like Ganguly's team had done at the Eden Gardens. \nKolkata was and continues to be, Ganguly's domain. Kohli has a similar connect with Bangalore, where he turns out for the Royal Challengers. Ganguly's men were yet to taste the highs Kohli's players have tasted. ( Tendulkar confident Virat Kohli and Co. will fight back against Australia ) \nIndia was a team that was still finding its way towards greatness. They had lost a previous home series at home against South Africa and before that, had been whitewashed in Australia. For that team to bounce back and hammer one of the best sporting sides in history, was a massive moment. \nKohli's team on the other hand, has been on a roll. They were undefeated for 19 Tests, starting mid-2015. They won nine out of 12 Tests in 2016 before a rude wake-up call in Pune. Kohli himself said it was not such a big deal, that a victory was never guaranteed. He was right. ( Virat Kohli's captaincy will be tested now: Michael Clarke to India Today ) \nSport is a great leveller. You could be flying high one day and be completely deflated the next. \nThe good thing is that Kohli does not need to look too far for inspiration. Will history repeat itself at the Chinnaswamy next week? That we have to see.

Written by Johnson T A | Bangalore | Published:February 28, 2017 3:19 am ISRO successfully launched a record 104 satellites, including Indias earth observation satellite on-board PSLV-C37/Cartosat2 Series from the spaceport of Sriharikota. (Source: PTI) \nShortly after the launch of a record 104 satellites on February 15 by the Indian Space Research Organisation’s workhorse PSLV rocket, the US start-up Planet Labs which owned 88 of the 104 satellites tweeted: “Happy to report that all of the 88 Doves are happy, healthy, and rotating in real-time!’’ Happy to report that all of the 88 Doves are happy, healthy, and rotating in real-time! pic.twitter.com/4xe8vWZnJr \n//platform.twitter.com/widgets.js \nWhile the 101 foreign satellites that flew on the PSLV C37 on February 15 and ISRO’s own 714 kg Cartosat-2 mapping satellite have stabilised and reported back to Earth stations with the first bits of data, two experimental Indian nano satellites – INS-1A and INS-1B weighing 8.4 kg and 9.7 kg – are yet to achieve stability to begin operations. \nThe satellites were built by ISRO. The record breaking PSLV C 37 launch on February 15 had carried 88 nano satellites from Planet Labs, eight satellites from another US mapping start-up called Spire, one satellite each from the Netherlands, Israel, UAE, Kazakhstan and Switzerland, apart from the nano satellites and the Cartosat-2. \nWhile ISRO has put out the first set of images taken by the Cartosat 2 series satellite, there has been no information about INS-1 A and INS 1-B since their launch even as data from some sites monitoring the satellites have indicated that the two have not stabilised despite over 10 days in space. \n“Attempts are being made to stabilise the experimental nano satellites that were launched. The efforts are still on,’’ ISRO director for publicity D P Karnik said. \nThe two nano satellites are being monitored by the ISRO Telemetry, Tracking and Command Network (ISTRAC) in Bengaluru. The experimental nano satellites are carrying instruments from ISRO’s Space Application Centre and the Laboratory for Electro Optic Systems. The data gathered will be used for internal purposes. \n“The nano satellites are an experimental class of satellites introduced by ISRO because there are many requests to use them for data collection for academic institutions. The universities do not have the knowledge to build satellites and tend to take a long time to build them. We want them to focus on the instruments since we can provide the nano satellite bus,’’ an ISRO official said. The ISRO official said ISTRAC was still in touch with the two small satellites launched 10 days ago. ",

      "title": "Zomato finally spills the beans about its ‘cloud kitchen’ project",
      "text": "After all the hullabaloo about Zomato’s aggressive investment plans, the online restaurant discovery platform has taken to its blog to clear the confusion regarding its cloud kitchen concept. Deepinder Goyal, Founder and CEO, Zomato \nIt said, \nThere has been a lot of confusion amongst our users, restaurateurs, and the media about our ‘cloud kitchen’ service. 'Cloud kitchens' is a new phrase which doesn’t yet have a definition and is used for a wide variety of business models. With this note, we are hoping to clarify what we are planning to do, and the underlying business model. About Zomato Infrastructure Services \nWith Zomato Infrastructure Services (ZIS), the company plans to work with current restaurant owners to expand their business to more locations without incurring any fixed cost. \nHighlighting some key points, the blog says that these infrastructure services could be seen as delivery-only food courts without any take-out or dine-in facilities. \nEach ZIS facility will have four or more co-located restaurant brands, leading to shared (and thus lower) costs. Each restaurant brand will have its own space of roughly 300 sqft and can have owned/shared/outsourced delivery personnel, thus increasing delivery efficiencies. \nZomato will provide the real estate, build the kitchen, and supply all the equipment for these brands to just ‘walk in’ and start their business in a matter of hours. Moreover, the build-out cost for these kitchens will be low owing to the company’s frugal and durable engineering to ensure limited expenses. \nFor example, Zomato is using its data to identify nearby restaurants that have recently shut down, acquiring their (almost new) equipment at close to scrap value. What are Zomato’s plans for it? \nWhile these kitchens will be common in the front, customers will be able to select dishes from multiple brands to build a single food order. \nThe infrastructure will be operational by the first or second week of March, with the pilot kitchen being in Dwarka. The company will test the waters for a couple of months post March, during which period no new locations will be opened. \nBased on initial estimates, Zomato is confident about having 100 locations by the end of 2018. \nAccording to the blog, there won’t be any fixed cost for restaurant brands to use ZIS. In fact, the platform will only charge the restaurants a nominal percentage of their revenue, saying that it is key for them to have these restaurants win. On top of this, restaurants will pay a nominal fee for any other services that they use — order lead generation, advertising, etc. \nMoreover, the company makes a conservative current projection to say that it will be able to recover its CAPEX in six to nine months’ time. Over time, as Zomato scales the business, it is confident that costs of operation should come down further and increase return on capital. \nThe blog goes on to explore in depth the reasons why Zomato is betting on ZIS. [Read here] \nIn November, it was reported that the Gurgaon-based company had actively been looking at cutting costs and had significantly increased its net revenues while cutting burn rates. \nThe company is also said to have been seeking funding for a while now, for which global investment bank Morgan Stanley had been roped in.

      "text": "NEW DELHI: Former Australia cricketer Michael Clarke is currently in India officiating as a commentator in the ongoing four-Test Border-Gavaskar Trophy between India and Australia.\nAustralia defeated India in the series opener in Pune and are now gearing up for the second Test to be played in Bangalore. With a few days left before the action resumes, Clarke took some time off and tried his hand mastering on driving an auto-rickshaw in Bengaluru.\nClarke shared a 22-second video on his official Facebook page in which he can be seen driving the famous auto-rickshaw or as the foreigners call it 'tuk-tuk'.\nHe captioned the video, \"Mastered the art of driving the tuk tuk. Nice to be back in Bengaluru where it all started.\"\nThe 35-year-old made his Test debut in Bangalore in 2004 and went on to have a storied career that also saw him succeeding Ricky Ponting as the captain. In all, he played 115 Tests scoring 8643 runs with the help of 28 centuries and 27 fifties at 49.10.\nThe Steve Smith-led Australia humiliated India in the first Test at Pune, defeating the hosts by 333 runs. Left-arm spinner Steve O'Keefe spun the visitors to a dominating win claiming 12 wickets for 70 runs, the best ever match figures by a visiting spinner in India.\nBoth teams are set to clash in the second Test at M Chinnaswamy Stadium beginning Saturday.",

      "text": "In Ashwath Hegde’s 10th-floor office in the south-Indian city of Bengaluru, plastic has become a multi-sensory experience.\n“Just see what happens,” Hegde says, tearing a piece from a small plastic bag and setting it on fire. “There are no fumes. Plastic normally has a horrible smell when it burns.”\nHegde summons one of his employees to bring in a glass of boiling water, and drops a sheet of the biodegradable non-toxic plastic in, stirring vigorously with a spoon as the bag shrivels and dissolves, leaving the water cloudy white. “100% soluble,” he says.\nThen he places a square of plastic on his tongue and, after slowly chewing, swallows it. “It’s completely edible! We’re not recommending that people eat these plastic bags but, if they do, nothing will happen to them. It’s totally safe.”\n'I am sacrificing my life to trigger concern about plastic in India' Read more\nHegde, 24, developed the bag, made entirely from tapioca and vegetable starches, as part of his mission to reduce India’s 14.8m tonnes of annual plastic consumption . That figure, among the highest in the world, is set to rise to a staggering 20m tonnes by 2020 as plastic usage increases with urbanisation.\nHegde is one of several entrepreneurs who have started formulating innovative solutions to the plastic waste problem. One company has started manufacturing cracker-like edible cutlery , while a handful of cities are building polymer roads .\nPlastic waste makes up a large chunk of Bengaluru’s 3,500 tonnes of daily waste . Walking the streets, its descent from “garden city” to “garbage city” is evident. Discarded cups, chocolate wrappers and bags litter ponds, parks and roadsides, clogging the already inadequate drainage system and causing artificial floods and traffic jams during the monsoon rains.\nPlus, says Swati Singh Sambyal, programme manager at the Centre for Science and Environment, roaming animals often consume plastic bags. “As per an estimate, on an average, 30kg of plastic has been found in the guts of cows in the country. People discard waste in plastic bags, and the animals searching for food consume the plastic, along with the leftover food materials. The plastic gets accumulated in their rumens and becomes hard. These animals look healthy, but that is just an illusion – they often die a slow and painful death due to starvation.”\nMunicipal efforts to curb the city’s overflowing garbage, under the campaign to clean up India spearheaded by the prime minister, Narendra Modi, have had limited success. Fines for unseparated rubbish have been introduced , rubbish trucks have been installed with GPS trackers to ensure they don’t cut routes, and a ban on plastic bags has been attempted. However, on the city’s fringes, landfills continue to be overburdened, and residents report having to close their doors because of the stench from piles of rubbish.\nThe situation is as bad or worse in many other Indian cities, says Sambyal: “Every day, 15,000 tonnes of plastic waste is generated in the country. Only 9,000 tonnes get collected.”\nFor Hegde, who grew up in a farming family in the coastal city of Mangalore, the rubbish mountains of modern, industrialised India are shocking. “In India , we treat the sun, earth and water as gods. I’m a Hindu, and this is part of our culture and our heritage. We must preserve it for future generations.”\nIn 2012, Hegde invested his own money to develop his new type of plastic. Though he is secretive about the manufacturing process, he has certificates from the Pollution Control Board and the Central Institute of Plastics Engineering and Technology to prove his products are biodegradable and can be digested if eaten by animals.\nLast year, his company, Envigreen , officially launched a line of plastic products including bags, medical aprons and packaging materials. He has received orders from brands such as L’Oréal, Metro Cash & Carry and Reliance. Already, Hegde says, he’s having to shift operations to a factory outside the city to meet growing demand. He hopes to conquer much more than the city of Bengaluru with his edible plastic. “Its my dream to create a global brand,” he says.\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Piles of rubbish accumulate by a lake in Bangalore where a population surge since the 1990s has vastly increased the problem of waste. Photograph: Manjunath Kiran/AFP/Getty Images\nAs India’s megacities grapple with waste, a number of municipalities – most recently the capital, Delhi – have started banning plastic bags, demanding vendors use jute or cloth instead. Hegde says his bags, if produced at scale, are much cheaper than the alternatives. And, he adds, they’re stronger and disposable – and will take only 45 days to decompose if left in the mud.\nHis success has unnerved a thriving polymer industry. Four million Indians are employed by the plastics industry , most of them in small and medium-sized enterprises. Undocumented, underground plastic manufacturers also sell cheap bags, ignoring government regulations about manufacturing standards.\nHegde says he has received threatening phone calls from competitors. “In India there is a big, plastic mafia. I have got phone calls saying, ‘We will steal your technology, we will stop you.’ I don’t know who these calls are from so I have never registered a complaint,” he says.\nHe dismisses the threats as part of doing business in India. “I am not bothered by them. They feel they’ve been here for years, that they have experience. But I’m not backing down.”\nNatural resources and development Plastic bags Plastics India South and Central Asia features ",

      "text": "BCCI finally acknowledges women cricketers in its awards BCCI finally acknowledges women cricketers in its awards The prize would be handed over during the BCCI Annual Awards ceremony in Bangalore on March 8. By: Express News Service | Kolkata | Published:February 28, 2017 1:19 am The prize would be handed over during the BCCI Annual Awards ceremony in Bangalore on March 8.(Representational image) \nThe Board of Control for Cricket in India (BCCI), for the first time, has decided to recognise the services rendered by Indian women cricketers, introducing a Lifetime Achievement Award for them. Former India captain Shanta Rangaswamy will be its first recipient. Rangaswamy played 16 Tests between 1976 and 1991, scoring 750 runs at 32.60 and taking 21 wickets at 31.61. In 19 ODIs between 1982 and 1986, she made 287 runs and bagged 12 scalps. The prize would be handed over during the BCCI Annual Awards ceremony in Bangalore on March 8. \nThis year’s choices come with a touch of novelty. For the first time, two former Indian cricketers have been picked for the men’s Lifetime Achievement Award, for the Col. CK Nayudu Trophy, who never played Test cricket. Left-arm spinners Rajinder Goel and Padmakar Shivalkar weren’t considered for international cricket despite taking 750 and 637 wickets respectively in first-class cricket. Goel played 157 first-class matches for Haryana and took his scalps at an average of 18.58. Shivalkar, the Bombay maestro, maintained a bowling average of 19.69 in 124 first-class fixtures. But with Bishan Bedi in his pomp, both Goel and Shivalkar missed out on representing the country. \n“The committee (Col. CK Nayudu Awards Committee) consisting of Mr N Ram, Mr Ramachandra Guha and Ms Diana Edulji believed that BCCI needs to recognise the services rendered by Mr Goel and Mr Shivalkar who were not fortunate enough to play for India,” the cricket board release said. \nFormer Tamil Nadu leg-spinner VV Kumar, who has played two Tests, and ex-India medium pacer, the late Ramakant Desai, have been nominated for the BCCI Special Award. The swashbuckling former India stumper Farokh Engineer will deliver the fifth MAK Pataudi Memorial Lecture before the awards ceremony. \nBengal body to appeal against COA directives \nMeanwhile, the Cricket Association of Bengal (CAB) has refused to follow the BCCI Committee of Administrators (COA) directives in toto as its working committee seriously mulled on filing an interim application before the Supreme Court, challenging certain clauses. The working committee meeting was held on Monday. \nAccording to some association insiders, Item No. 2 that has set a nine-year tenure for office-bearers either in the BCCI or state association, is the real bone of contention. Obtaining “undertakings” from current office-bearers and working committee members as per the Item No. 3 of the directives, hasn’t also gone down well with the CAB members. Some state associations have already filed an application before the apex court, requesting for the permission of holding a BCCI Special General Meeting. In a separate application, BCCI joint-secretary Amitabh Choudhary has requested for the permission to perform the assigned task of an office-bearer. Both applications have been notified on Monday.

      "text": "Map: India \nPune's debut as a Test venue last week proved far from memorable with the pitch used for India's first Test against Australia incurring a \"poor\" rating from match referee Chris Broad on Tuesday. \nAs if India's 333-run defeat inside three days was not bad enough for the hosts, the bone-dry track at the Maharashtra Cricket Association Stadium fell foul of the pitch and outfield monitoring process of the International Cricket Council (ICC). \nThe home side's ploy backfired as the tourists' spinners claimed 17 of the 20 Indian wickets — including figures of 12-70 for Steven O'Keefe — to put them 1-0 up in the four-match series and snap India's 19-Test unbeaten streak. \nAustralia's former nemesis, spinner Harbhajan Singh commented after the result, saying the pitch, not O'Keefe's bowling, was the catalyst for the home side's defeat. \nIndia's cricket board has 14 days to respond to Broad's report. An ICC team will review the response and study footage before ruling whether the pitch was substandard. \nThe punishment for a first \"poor\" rating for any venue ranges from warning to a maximum of a $US15,000 ($19,600) fine with a directive for appropriate corrective action. \nThe second Test between India and Australia will be played on a \"sporting\" pitch which will be fair to both teams, organisers in Bangalore have said. \nReuters / ABC",

Lokesh Rahul SHUTS down fan who tried to troll him for his poor form \nLokesh Rahul certainly seems to have taken a leaf out of R Ashwin's book in terms of dealing with trolls on social media. Last Updated: Tuesday, February 28, 2017 - 14:38 0 Follow @ZeeNewsSports \nNew Delhi: Indian opener Lokesh Rahul, who looked convincing across formats in 2016, has been struggling to rediscover his mojo in 2017. \nThe Bangalore batsman had a forgettable limited-overs series against England, where he managed to score just 125 runs from six matches. Even in the one-off Test against Bangladesh, Rahul failed to find his rhythm and was dismissed for scores of 2 and 10 rspectively. \nWhen Rahul posted an update on Twitter on Tuesday, one of the fans tried to troll him for his poor form. \nHere's what the fan tweeted: @klrahul11 @ashwinravi99 ye sab chhodo .. runs kaise bane uspe dhyan de .. \n— BeingChirag Dave (@BeingChiragDave) February 28, 2017 \nRahul, who usually doesn't reply to trolls, was tempted to leave a reply and here's what he tweeted back: Plz come and teach us bhai. Im sure aapko pata hain kaise banate hain runs. https://t.co/KyiuAWFusz \n— K L Rahul (@klrahul11) February 28, 2017 \nRahul was followed by premier Indian off-spinner Ravichandran Ashwin on Twitter today. \nThe stylish right-hander certainly seems to have taken a leaf out of the offie's book in terms of dealing with trolls on social media.

But this couple, who got married in Kerala, has decided to ride northwards along the coast due to their love for the ocean, that too with no fixed timeline or deadline. | Bangalore Mirror Bureau | Mar 1, 2017, 08.38 AM IST Lokavya and Gomathy soaking in at Bantwal MANGALURU: Generally, newlyweds plan their honeymoon much in advance, choosing an exotic location to make it memorable. But this couple, who got married in Kerala, has decided to ride northwards along the coast due to their love for the ocean, that too with no fixed timeline or deadline. Lokavya Meenakshi Kurup from Kerala, a former employee of National Centre for Biological Sciences, Bengaluru, married Gomathy Shankar, a freelance behavioural and soft skills trainer in Chennai. Lokavya tells Bangalore Mirror that they got married at an ancient temple in Palakkad in the presence of family members and close relatives and had a reception near the beach on February 6.\"Although we are not hardcore riders, we have been passionate about bikes and long rides and were thinking about going on this ride since two months,\" she says. The big surprise came when Shankar gifted his newlywed wife Lokavya a classic Royal Enfield on their wedding day. He already has a Thunderbird of his own. This was an inspiration for them to take up the journey on two bikes, side by side. They reached Thiruvananthapuram on February 14, and started their journey from Kanyakumari the next day and they hope to complete this journey in Rann of Kutch at Dholavira, an archaeological site at Khadirbet in Bhachau Taluka of Kutch District. \"We understand that it is Bansi Bhatt, 50 years peak summer and driving could be tough; but for us, it is about being together. We are not in a hurry; we are taking breaks and riding slowly, halting at sunset,\" she says. On Sunday, the couple reached the tree house at Varanashi Organic Farms at Adyanadka in Bantwal, about 50 km from Mangaluru. This is probably the only destination for which they moved slightly away from the coast, but a destination that they could not afford to miss.\"It is not that we are riding only on the highways. In fact, we are trying our best to avoid the highways, even if it means riding for longer durations.For instance, Kozhikode to Kumble is about four hours' ride, but we took about 12 hours. We do not want to miss places during this journey. We are on a complete holiday. We eat a lot and relax. We have no deadlines to meet. Every day, we wake up and plan our day,\" says Shankar. The couple is excited as they were welcomed by Dr Srinath, Lokavya's brother.He escorted them into Mangaluru on his Harley Davidson. Wherever they have been so far, they have received unusual attention and are in love with every moment of this epic journey.They are heading to Gokarna on Tuesday .  ",

      "text": "Fit-again Krunal Pandya finds form ahead of IPL Fit-again Krunal Pandya finds form ahead of IPL Written by Vishal Menon | New Delhi | Published:March 1, 2017 1:53 am Krunal made 79 runs in Baroda’s 75-run win over Punjab. Saundarya Mehra \nAnyone who has witnessed Krunal Pandya bludgeon 86 off 37 deliveries against Delhi Daredevils during last year’s IPL will swear by his power-hitting ability. On Tuesday, in the Vijay Hazare Trophy, Krunal fashioned a knock that was bereft of any of the histrionics he displayed for the Mumbai Indians last year. He, however, admitted that this was a satisfying knock nonetheless. \nOn Tuesday, at Delhi’s Karnail Singh Stadium, Krunal summoned his reserves to score an uncharacteristically subdued knock of 79. He faced over 100 deliveries, with nine boundaries punctuating his knock. He was also involved in a stand of 102 runs with opener Aditya Waghmod. Against a pretty competent Punjab bowling attack, led by Sandeep Sharma and Siddharth Kaul, Krunal was the lynchpin of Baroda’s batting. On a pitch with variable bounce, he showed admirable application to hold fort and take his team to 249 — which proved to be a match-winning total. “This was a really satisfying knock for me. The pitch was not really easy to bat on, and I was circumspect early on. I’m glad this came in a match-winning cause for my team,” Krunal said after Baroda had defeated Punjab by 75 runs. Watch What Else Is Making News \nThe knock will go a long way in giving Krunal the much-needed confidence he needs for the upcoming IPL season (he has been retained by the Mumbai Indians), more so after returning from a torn left quadricep that ruled him out of the last Ranji season. Instead of sounding dejected, Krunal took the setback in his stride. \n“Injury ke baad jitna bhi khel sakta hoon, mein kheloonga. Injuries are all part and parcel of life. Isse khudka patience level badh jata hain. When you return from such an injury, it makes you much stronger as a player,” he reasoned, sounding a tad philosophical. \nFor the moment, Krunal is not looking too far ahead. Returning from a four-month lay-off, the 25-year-old is a tad cautious in his approach, and taking only one game at a time. He reckoned that the ongoing Vijay Hazare tournament was the ideal platform for him to find his verve. \nThe injury lay-off was a cruel speed-breaker for Krunal’s fledgling career. It was during this time that he saw his younger brother Hardik make his T20 International as well as ODI debut. As Krunal worked to regain fitness at the NCA in Bangalore, Hardik made a strong case for himself as a bowling all-rounder for India. \nHaving started their careers together — at the U-13 and U-15 levels — at Kiran More’s academy in Baroda, the brothers are extremely fond of each other and feed off each other’s success. “My brother and I would get Maggi for Rs 5, and would ask the gardener to prepare hot water so that we could prepare and eat it for lunch and breakfast,” Hardik had told The Indian Express sometime back. \nKrunal, on his part, is mighty pleased at his brother’s progress in international cricket. “After his disastrous T20 debut, the manner in which he came back in his ODI debut at Dharamsala was really impressive. He is improving match by match, and season after season,” he said. Hardik’s ambition to seal a spot in India’s Test eleven is well known. “I don’t think he is overly worried about this. It’s only a matter of time before he breaks through in the Test team. It’s not necessary that you have to be playing to gain experience. Sometime, you can learn a lot by just being in the 15-man squad. So, when he gets a look-in, I think he will be ready,” Krunal added. \nHardik off to Bangalore \nHardik, who was released from the 15-member Test squad against Australia to play the Vijay Hazare Trophy, featured in the first three games for Baroda. On Tuesday evening, the all-rounder had put this message on his Snap Chat: “Thank you Delhi… off to Bangalore”, indicating he would be joining India’s Test squad ahead of the second Test.

      "text": "Sitar player and composer Shubhendra Rao was in for a shock recently when after landing in Nice , France, for a performance, he found that his sitar had been vandalized by the authorities of the European airline he travelled on. The result: he couldn't perform.\nSpeaking to Bangalore Times , a visibly hurt Shubhendra said, 'The airline surgically opened my instrument and broke it. I was travelling from Vienna to Nice. Two hours before my performance in Nice, I opened my instrument box to found that they had surgically prised it open. Of course, I couldn't do the concert. I can't even begin to explain the mental agony that I went through. The sitar is like a part of my body; I don't have two hands, I have three, because as a musician, you become very emotionally attached to your instrument. It's like watching your child being slaughtered. A single individual cannot take on a corporate, which is why I have created a lot of pressure on social media. There have been many responses, since I am not the first, nor am I going to be the last person (to who this has happened). The airline responded because of the online pressure, but they have not given any explanation ' they just said that they regret the inconvenience caused and that there will be an investigation.'\nThe musician says that this was more than just mishandling, and adds that there are other angles. 'One is that someone was searching for drugs inside the sitar. But it could also be a hate crime, because people are paranoid of anything different these days,' says Shubhendra.",

The occasion is also o widely spread a message about the significance of scientific applications in the daily life of the people. File image of CV Raman. Wikimedia Commons \nThe then Central government was asked to honour this event always in the future by the National Council for Science and Technology Communication (NCSTC) in the year 1986. According to space-india.com , every year NCSTC announces a new theme to celebrate. \nIn the spirit of this day, New Delhi-based Science Popularisation Association of Communicators and Educators (SPACE) organisation conducts various science related activities involving public, school and college students. \nTheme of the year \nThis year's theme is 'Science and technology for specially-abled persons', in accordance with which New Delhi-based Science Popularisation Association of Communicators and Educators (SPACE) organisation will take skill development classes — air rocket construction and launching, weigh yourself on different planets, catch the meteors, ring the planet, astronaut can you be one, take a picture as an astronaut and dress as an alien and astronaut, the organisation said in a statement on Monday. \nChildren and youngsters — from the Asthavakra School, Rohini; Sparsh Foundation, Kalyan Vihar and Model Town in Delhi; Nirdosh School, Sarbha Nagar in Ludhiana and Sankalp-Open School and Learning Centre in Chennai, will participate in the initiative by SPACE. \nThe organisation also conducts various science related activities with public, school and college students and have successfully organised various programmes such as Astronomy fairs and competitions with the objective to create enthusiasm among people and to inculcate scientific temper among the masses. \nPhysically and visually impaired children and youngsters in Delhi, Ludhiana and Chennai will get an opportunity to learn various aspects of astronomy as part of the National Science Day celebrations in the country, SPACE said on Monday. \nLife of Sir CV Raman \nAccording to Nobel.org , Chandrasekhara Venkata Raman was born at Tiruchirappalli in Southern India on 7 November 1888. His father was a lecturer in mathematics and physics so that from the first he was immersed in an academic atmosphere. He entered Presidency College, Madras, in 1902, and in 1904 passed his BA examination, winning the first place and the gold medal in physics; in 1907 he gained his MA degree, obtaining the highest distinctions. \nHis earliest researches in optics and acoustics — the two fields of investigation to which he has dedicated his entire career — were carried out while he was a student. \nSince at that time a scientific career did not appear to present the best possibilities, Raman joined the Indian Finance Department in 1907; though the duties of his office took most of his time, Raman found opportunities for carrying on experimental research in the laboratory of the Indian Association for the Cultivation of Science at Calcutta (of which he became Honorary Secretary in 1919). \nIn 1917, he was offered the newly endowed Palit Chair of Physics at Calcutta University, and decided to accept it. After 15 years in Calcutta, he became Professor at the Indian Institute of Science at Bangalore (1933-1948), and since 1948 he was the director of the Raman Institute of Research at Bangalore, which was established and endowed by him. He also founded the Indian Journal of Physics in 1926, of which he is the Editor. Raman sponsored the establishment of the Indian Academy of Sciences and has served as President since its inception. He also initiated the proceedings of that academy, in which much of his work has been published, and is President of the Current Science Association, Bangalore, which publishes Current Science (India) . \nRaman's accomplishments \nNobel.org says that some of Raman's early memoirs appeared as Bulletins of the Indian Association for the Cultivation of Science . In 1922 he published his work on the \"Molecular Diffraction of Light\", the first of a series of investigations with his collaborators which ultimately led to his discovery, on the 28th of February, 1928, of the radiation effect which bears his name and which brought him the 1930 Nobel Prize in Physics. \nOther investigations carried out by Raman were: His experimental and theoretical studies on the diffraction of light by acoustic waves of ultrasonic and hypersonic frequencies (published 1934-1942), and those on the effects produced by X-rays on infrared vibrations in crystals exposed to ordinary light. In 1948 Raman, through studying the spectroscopic behaviour of crystals, approached in a new manner fundamental problems of crystal dynamics. His laboratory has been dealing with the structure and properties of diamond, the structure and optical behaviour of numerous iridescent substances (labradorite, pearly felspar, agate, opal, and pearls). \nAmong his other interests have been the optics of colloids, electrical and magnetic anisotropy, and the physiology of human vision. \nRaman has been honoured with a large number of honorary doctorates and memberships of scientific societies. He was elected a Fellow of the Royal Society early in his career (1924), and was knighted in 1929. \nRaman Effect \nAccording to Britannica.com , Raman effect , change in the wavelength of light that occurs when a light beam is deflected by molecules. When a beam of light traverses a dust-free, transparent sample of a chemical compound, a small fraction of the light emerges in directions other than that of the incident (incoming) beam. Most of this scattered light is of unchanged wavelength. A small part, however, has wavelengths different from that of the incident light; its presence is a result of the Raman effect.

      "text": "Though Mitchell dismissed Virat for a duck in the first innings at Pune, the Aussie pacer believes the Indian skipper will come back 'bigger and stronger'\nAustralia's Mitchell Starc (second from left) celebrates with teammates after dismissing Virat Kohli during the second day of the first Test in Pune last Friday. Kohli was dismissed for 13 in the second innings by spinner Steve O’Keefe the following day. Pic/AFP \nNew Delhi: Mitchell Starc may have won the opening duel against Indian skipper Virat Kohli by getting the star batsman out for a duck in the first Test, but the Australian fast bowler insists the battle has just begun.\n\nStarc triggered India's downfall in last week's first Test in Pune by claiming the wickets of Cheteshwar Pujara and Kohli in quick succession in the first innings before left-arm spinner Steve O'Keefe took charge.\nAustralia bowled out India for paltry totals of 105 and 107 in the two innings, with O'Keefe taking a total of 12 wickets as the visitors wrapped up a 333-run win inside three days.\nKohli, who has been in red-hot form in recent months, had a rare failure with scores of 0 and 13 in his two outings. Guilty of chasing Starc's wide delivery outside the off-stump, Kohli gave away a catch to Peter Handscomb at first slip and the batting soon fell apart on a sharply turning wicket.\n\"We know (Kohli) is going to be another key wicket for the rest of the series. There's six more times we've got to get him out to really cement this series,\" Starc said.\n\"We know he'll come back bigger and stronger, but he's one I'll take over Pujara at the moment,\" Starc said when asked to rate the importance of his twin strikes in Pune.\nStarc and Kohli are former teammates for the Indian Premier League (IPL) side Royal Challengers Bangalore, and the Australian is well aware of how dangerous the Indian skipper can be once he gets his eye in.\n\"He's a class player, we all know that. He's scored a mountain of runs already this year. We're going to have to be wary of that Virat comeback,\" Starc said of Kohli, who has scored double centuries in four successive series.\n\"We are really happy that it happened that way for us, but we know that one Test is not going to win us the series. It's three Test matches to go.\"",

There were 7,000 saris in all manner of design and material, clearly worth crores of rupees. And these were only some of the items found during a raid on Tuesday at the house of the Deputy Commissioner, Commercial Taxes, in Hubballi. Bangalore Mirror Bureau | Mar 1, 2017, 08.28 AM IST 7,000 saris in all manner of design and material, clearly worth crores of rupees. It took investigators from the Anti-Corruption Bureau 6 hours to put a number to what they had seen inside the wardrobe . There were 7,000 saris in all manner of design and material, clearly worth crores of rupees. And these were only some of the items found during a raid on Tuesday at the house of the Deputy Commissioner , Commercial Taxes , in Hubballi . According to sources, the entire room was full of saris, which were reportedly being used by the wife of the official, Kariayappa N. When they asked her about it, she claimed she was running a business but then, on further questioning, couldn't substantiate the claim with evidence. \"It took almost 6 hours to see and count every sari in the house. The wife of an official from the commercial taxes department having so many expensive saris is hard to believe. It is possible that he may have raided sari shops and kept the clothes,\" an ACB officer said. While the saris alone would collectively be worth a few crores, investigators also found several documents for properties owned by him, his wife and relatives, including three houses, a flat in Bengaluru, agricultural land, and plots. They also found jewellery, shoes, watches and accessories. The couple's two children are studying abroad. BBMP's TenderSURE man owns 150 acres The house of KT Nagaraj, a Chief Engineer with the Bruhat Bengaluru Mahanagara Palike (BBMP) -- who is also in charge of TenderSURE works across Bengaluru -- was raided by the ACB investigators on Tuesday morning. Investigators found several kilograms of gold jewellery in addition to property papers under names of various family members at his house in Jayanagar, 3rd Block. A senior ACB official said they found that he had bought 150 acres of coffee estate in Sakleshpur and Hassan districts in his own name as well as his wife's and relative's. \"We also found more than 10 kg of gold, Rs 7 lakh cash in new currency, five high-end cars, property documents for four plots in Bengaluru, two houses and one commercial complex. Two more lockers are yet to be checked. He has been buying the estate for the last five years and the most recent purchase has been done last year. Nagaraj was heading major roads at BBMP as chief engineer and was then transferred to head of all projects. He was heading the whole TenderSURE project across Bengaluru,\" the officer said. PD Kumar, Assistant Executive Engineer, Bangalore Development Authority (BDA), was also raided by the ACB, which found properties worth crores of rupees, and Rs 2 lakh cash. They found that he had two houses, six sites in Bengaluru and Davanagere, commercial complex at JP Nagar, and agricultural land of around 10 acres at Harapanahalli. The raids were also conducted on five other government officials from various departments: Saleem Sabusab, deputy tahasildar, Belagavi; PD Kumar, Assistant Executive Engineer, BDA; Karunakar, RTO Senior Inspector from Shivamogga; Jagannath from Bidar Taluk Panchayat; and A Shivakumar, a PDO from Gadag.

That should stop people leaving quite so many angry comments under stories, they hope. \nStories that use the quiz will see people presented with three short multiple choice questions that they must give the correct response to. So, for instance, people might have to correctly answer what an acronym that is used in the story stands for, for instance. Trump confused with Alec Baldwin's SNL impersonation by newspaper \nThe creators of the tool – which for the moment is in use on NKRbeta, the broadcasters' tech page – hope that it will ensure that everyone knows what they're talking about before they actually start talking about it. \n\"We thought we should do our part to try and make sure that people are on the same page before they comment,\" journalist Ståle Grut told Nieman Lab, which first reported the news . If everyone can agree that this is what the article says, then they have a much better basis for commenting on it.” \nThe extra time should also force people to think a little more deeply about what they are commenting on. \n“If you spend 15 seconds on it, those are maybe 15 seconds that take the edge off the rant mode when people are commenting,” said Marius Arnesen, editor of NKRbeta. \nMost of NKRbeta has developed a dedicated following who talk positively in the comments on its articles. But occasionally its stories are published on the homepage or elsewhere – which brings a whole new set of often angry readers, who tend to undermine the tone in the comments, said NKRbeta journalists. \nMany sites have got rid of comments altogether, arguing that they are becoming hard to maintain, tend to become negative quickly and that people can have their own conversations on Facebook or elsewhere. \nOther websites have attempted to tackle the problem with different technologies. Google announced last week, for instance, that it had built an artificially intelligent tool that can read through comments and identify whether or not they are \"toxic\". More about: ",

      "text": "Flipboard \nCo-working can be best defined as the practice of sharing an office with strangers rather than working by oneself at home. Working in a co-working space has become the latest trend owing to its many advantages. It is an innovative alternative to traditional cubicles and make-shift setups like a coffee shop. This type of working has been proven to be beneficial for running a business and maintaining a professional career. It not only helps you quickly and efficiently network but also helps your business grow exponentially with the new contacts you make. If you’re still wondering why to invest in a co-working space, here are some pointers for you. \nImage : shutterstock Easy on the pocket \nSeveral co-working spaces offer an economical and affordable rent , especially in comparison to hiring an entire corporate office space. Most won't even get you to sign a long-term contract. Depending on your requirements, you'll be able to find places that offer daily rates or even month-long contracts. This will ensure that you aren't committing to a place until and unless you're absolutely sure about it. Most co-working spaces offer access to basic necessities as well. So you won't have to invest in fax machines and printers at least at the beginning of your business. Make new connections \nNo matter what business you're running, who you know is just as important as what you know. Apart from being affordable, one of the main advantages of working at a co-working space is that everyone who walks through the door is a professional in their own right and will enrich you either personally or professionally with their personality and skill set. Working from home needs a certain amount of motivation to get out of bed, switch on the laptop, and accomplish your day's tasks. On the other hand, at a co-working space you'll be surrounded by similar minded people who will be just as passionate and goal-driven as you are, and this will push you to be a better version of yourself. Easy accessibility to talent \nCo-working spaces attract a wide variety of talent from various industries and different fields. If you're stuck with a persistent problem, you can be sure that the person sitting next to you will have a solution to your problem. Take advantage of the fact that you can trade and share skills with those around you as this will help you gain a lot of potential clients and customers in the process. You can also scout for and hire individuals, either on a project basis or long term, to help you out with certain aspects of your business. With the best of talent available at an arm's distance, one would be a fool to not make use of it. \nCo-working is a resourceful way to increase the positive effects of a work place, while mitigating the negative effects of working at home or in a public space. There is a constant feeling of community and bonhomie in a shared work place which makes this concept of corporate functioning an innovative one. Calling all Bangalore startups!

      "text": "Facebook uses artificial intelligence to help prevent suicides The social network has rolled out new tools in tandem with partners Bangalore Correspondent, IDG News Service | Mar 1, 2017 5:23 AM PT Email a friend Use commas to separate multiple email addresses From Your message has been sent. Sorry There was an error emailing this page. Credit: Facebook Inside Google's Loon and Wing \nFacebook is using a combination of pattern recognition, live chat support from crisis support organizations and other tools to prevent suicide, with a focus on its Live service. \nThere is one death by suicide every 40 seconds and over 800,000 people kill themselves every year , according to the World Health Organization. “Facebook is in a unique position — through friendships on the site — to help connect a person in distress with people who can support them,” the company said Wednesday. \nThe move by Facebook appears to aim to prevent the live-streaming of suicides on the Live platform, which was launched in April last year , and allows people, public figures and pages to share live videos with friends and followers. In January, a 14-year-old-girl in Miami live-streamed her suicide on the platform. \nThe company said that its suicide prevention tools for Facebook posts will now be integrated into Live, giving people watching a live video the option to reach out to the person directly and to report the video to the company. \nA person sharing a live video will also see a set of resources on their screen and can choose to reach out to a friend, contact a help line or see tips. “We will also provide resources to the person reporting the live video to assist them in helping their friend,” Facebook said. \nPeople will also have the option to connect to crisis support partners such as Crisis Text Line, the National Eating Disorder Association and the National Suicide Prevention Lifeline over Messenger. They will see the option to message with someone in real time directly from the organizations' page or through Facebook’s suicide prevention tools. \nFacebook has also started testing pattern recognition technology to identify posts as very likely to include thoughts of suicide. Even if someone on Facebook has not reported the post yet, the platform's Community Operations team will review the posts and, if appropriate, provide resources to the person who posted the content, the company said. \nThe new measures add to those the company already has in place for over 10 years, it said. It already has teams around the world, working around the clock to review reports that come in and prioritize the most serious reports like suicide.

      "text": "Flipboard \nThe year hasn’t started on the right note for Uber. A week after Silicon Valley was taken by storm by Uber’s ex-employee Susan Fowler writing a blog on the sexual harassment she faced and the blind eye the management turned to it, Uber’s CEO on Tuesday fired their SVP of Engineering Amit Singhal, one of the valley’s top engineers. \nAccording to a report in Recode, Travis Kalanick asked Amit to leave because he had not disclosed to the cab aggregator the precise circumstances amid which he left Google. Top executives at the search giant had informed Amit that their internal investigation team had found an employee’s sexual harassment allegations against him credible. \nUber found out about this earlier this week when Recode informed the team of the events that had taken place between Amit and Google. The report also said that although Uber’s executives had conducted extensive research and background checks, they had been unable to uncover the circumstances of his exit from Google. \nAmit has denied the allegation throughout, and in an email to Recode Founder Kara Swisher said: \n“Harassment is unacceptable in any setting. I certainly want everyone to know that I do not condone and have not committed such behaviour. In my 20-year career, I’ve never been accused of anything like this before and the decision to leave Google was my own.” Travis Kalanick and Amit Singhal | Image Source: Amit's Twitter \nFor close to a week now, sexual harassment — one of the darkest secrets of the startup world both in Silicon Valley and India — has been in the limelight. After Susan’s post, Uber’s management structure and HR department were depicted in a sexist and dysfunctional light. \nMultiple sources have discussed the claims of an encounter between Amit and a female employee with former Google HR head Laszlo Bock and also Google CEO Sundar Pichai in late 2015 . Amit had denied the claims at that point in time. However, after Christmas, he resigned after a 15-year stint at Google. \nThe sources said that Google was prepared to fire Amit over the allegations after looking into the incident, but that it did not have to do so after he resigned. \nIt also claimed that the female employee who filed the formal complaint did not work for him directly, but worked closely with the search team. She also did not want to go public with the charges, which is apparently why Google decided to allow him to leave quietly. \nCalling all Bangalore startups!

      "text": "Starc difference: ‘Softie’ toughens up Starc difference: ‘Softie’ toughens up Being nice came easy to Mitchell Starc, but then a stint with Allan Donald & Craig McDermott unshackled his inner mongrel. Written by Sriram Veera | Bangalore | Published:March 2, 2017 1:28 am Mitchell Starc expects his — and pace partner Josh Hazlewood’s — workload to be heavier in Bangalore. Reuters \nIn a plush hotel in Dubai, sometime in 2014, Allan Donald called over Mitch Starc for a chat. They were in the Bangalore’s IPL team — Donald the coach, Starc the young fast bowler from Australia. Donald wanted to know whether Starc had it in him to take the next step as a fast bowler and become a leader. \n“I felt he had it, but wanted to hear from him. I asked him, are you ready to become a leader?” Donald recalls now. Leadership has been a pet theme with Donald; you would find the adjective constantly popping up in his talks. He believes it’s what separates the ones who can merely bowl quick and the fastmen who go on to become great bowlers. It’s about having control over the art of fast bowling but goes beyond that — “work ethic, hunger, desire to become great, ruthless, ability and keenness to set an example to other bowlers in the team, and be a mongrel of sorts on field…” Donald lists them out with feverish passion. \nStarc looked up at him that day and said, “Yes, I would love to do that”. Watch What Else Is Making News \nIt wasn’t going to be that easy of course and it wasn’t. A few months after that, in December 2014, Shane Warne would famously term Starc’s body language as “soft” in a Test against India in Brisbane. Starc was dropped after that game and though Warne’s remarks were interpreted as too harsh, it was something that the Australian camp was already working on. In particular, the bowling coach Craig McDermott, who no one would have called a softie during his career, and the head coach Darren Lehmann. \nMcDermott termed it as “presence” at the crease. “It was something we have talked about even before Warnie got stuck into him,” McDermott had said. \nBeing nice came easy to Starc. There is a video of Glenn Maxwell interviewing Virat Kohli where the talk swerves to Starc, and Kohli pipes up, “He is such a wonderful human being”, and Maxwell chips in: “Yeah, he is a softie!” \nAnd a cutie. Not often do you hear stories of a childhood romance coming to fruition in adulthood. Starc was nine when he walked into an academy with dreams of becoming a wicketkeeper. His chief competition in that selection camp was a blonde-haired girl Alysa, daughter of Ian Healy, and luckily for him, both were selected and trained for a while before Alysa moved away from the boy’s camp. Years later they would marry each other, to complete an awww-inducing story. Someday it should play out as a movie on the Romedy channel. Even Notting Hill wasn’t this soppy. \nIt was one of the coaches in a U-15 camp who saw him bowl medium pace who told him to forget keeping and use his height and natural action to start bowling fast. The first thing you notice is the rhythmic run-up. Wasim Akram and Donald have salivated over it in the past, and it’s easy to see why. With some fast bowlers you tend to notice the odd things — the bobbing head, flailing arms, the lack of fluidity in the run with things falling in place only at the last instant, and a final effort near the crease which sets these oddities right. Not with Starc. Everything seems perfectly synced and the end result seems an obvious culmination of sorts. \nWasim Akram was on air commentating when he saw Starc bowl for the first time against India. Excited with what he saw, he later had a half-hour chat, leaving Starc with one advice in particular: Snap the wrist at release to get more swing. \nIt was to Akram that Donald himself would return to last August in Sri Lanka when he went with the Australian team as their bowling coach for the tour. By this time, Starc had already amped up as a leader. If anything, the softie had turned cold-blooded and ruthless. So much so that he had started to throw the balls back at the batsmen and Steve Smith had to pull him up publicly for his behavior. Even McDermott wanted his man to hold back a bit. “I have seen him go the other way now — sometimes he can go a little bit too far sometimes. You don’t want to get too over aggressive because you forget what you are trying to do with the ball and what you are trying to do with the batsmen. I am pretty pleased with the way he goes about his bowling at the minute,” McDermott said. \nReverse swing was the theme of the Sri Lankan tour for Donald and Starc. During one of the initial chats, Donald who was talking about the angles of release and where the ball should start moving in the air to create problems realised it was better to tell Starc to observe the master instead. “I told him, if there is one bowler you want to watch and learn about all these things, is Wasim Akram. What a bowler he was — he had everything and more.” Inspired from Akram’s videos, and close-monitoring from Donald, the ball began to do Starc’s bidding on that tour. \nEverything falls in place \nThere was a dismissal of Kushal Mendis — Starc’s 100 th Test wicket — when everything fell in place. Just as Donald wanted, the ball started to tail in from just outside leg stump, land in line of stumps, and Mendis, past his hundred, gets squared-up. “You need to force the batsman to play at it from an awkward angle, and out of position, play it across the line,” Donald says now. “The ball began to jag away past Mendis who by this stage is alarmed that it might knock out his off stump and he stabbed at the ball. Edge and gone. “With AD, I’ve been working pretty much on that delivery that got Mendis out with that reversing ball,” Starc would say later. \n“We worked at the release position to get him to know the angles he can work. It’s difficult thing to do but he is a very fast learner,” Donald says. \nDonald believes Starc has the inner mongrel in him and has become ruthless. “If you see, he bowls a lot of bouncers now than what he did a year and half. We have talked about it in the past: ‘Get the aggro going, let the batsmen know he can’t come forward, and let the menace always be there.’ \n“He has everything already. There aren’t many fast bowlers who can bowl Yorkers with the new ball as he does. Unlike many, he doesn’t hesitate to bowl the new ball full most often than not. That’s when, combined with the short deliveries, you are going to get the edges and hit the stumps. He can reverse from over and round the stumps. He can hurt you with the new and the bad ball, and after Sri Lanka series, knows how to adapt himself to subcontinent conditions.” \n“You can’t coach a guy to be a leader if he doesn’t want to. There are some who just bowl and go. Starc is one guy who wants it badly. He is like McGrath, Shane Warne and wants to be that person who loves the ball and be a man all the time. You can’t coach stuff like that. Starc has it. He is very very special. If I have to describe him in one word: Attitude. He is a proper one hundred percenter. He would walk through the wall for his team.” \nOf late, Starc has started to get more potent from round the stumps as well. Running in smoothly, managing not to get locked-up in his body position, still managing to camouflage the shiny side from the batsmen. “What we worked on was to get him to release from wide of the crease. It’s still a work in progress for Starc. He is only going to get better at it.” That’s a scary thought for the batsmen worldwide — that Starc can still get better. Best of Express",

The documentation of the treasure unearthed at the famed Sree Padmanabhaswamy temple last year began Monday morning with a joint meeting of the two committees appointed by the Supreme Court. The temple is believed to have a treasure trove of precious jewels which is estimated to be worth more than Rs.one lakh crore, making it the richest temple in the world, the Hindustan Times reported on Monday. REUTERS/Danish Siddiqui (INDIA - Tags: SOCIETY RELIGION) ADVERTISEMENT Thiruvananthapuram, Pune and Kolkata rank as the top three cities on an annual survey of city-systems, but even the best-ranking city scores a grade of 4.4 out of 10 as against 9.9 for New York. Dragging Indian cities down is their score on governance and planning indicators. The Annual Survey of India's City-Systems (ASICS) 2016 conducted by the Bangalore-based urban research and advocacy group, Janaagraha, scores 21 cities in 18 states on 83 parameters divided into four main components - Urban Planning & Design, Empowered & Legitimate Political Representation, Urban Capacities & Resources, and Transparency, Accountability & Participation. Thiruvananthapuram was the top-ranked city last year as well; the city scored particularly well on citizen interest in local elections and on its ability to address citizen complaints. In 2016, Mumbai was ranked fourth while Delhi ninth, both megacities' ranks worsening by two ranks since 2015. Even India's top-ranked cities, however, had moderate scores compared to the best globally; the highest score an Indian city got was 4.4 out of 10 as against 9.4 for London and 9.9 for New York on the same indicators. Across the board, cities scored the least on governance indicators; all cities scored 0 out of 10 on effective mechanisms to deal with City Plan violations (compared to 10 for London or New York). Delhi ranked the best on planning and design, Mumbai on capacities and resources, and Thiruvananthapuram on political representation and transparency. Delhi ranked as the only city with adequate staff for its needs; barring Delhi and Mumbai, cities have an average of less than 350 municipal staff for every 1 lakh residents. Delhi, Chennai, Kolkata and Mumbai are also the only cities with at least 1 planner for every 1 lakh citizens. There is also wide variation in how much city's spend on their citizens. Mumbai alone spends as much on its 12.4 million citizens (Rs 33,168 crore in 2014-15) as the next ten most populous cities put together on their 54.4 million citizens. As a result, Mumbai's per capita expenditure on its citizens (Rs 26,657) is over four times that of the next ten cities. At the other end of the scale, Patna spends just Rs 1,114 annually on each citizen. The report also points to the shambles that city finances are in. Many cities do not even generate enough revenue to cover staff salaries; in Patna, salaries accounted for 320% of the city corporation's revenue in 2014-15. Even Mumbai funded only 66% of its expenditure from its own revenue, a figure that falls to as low as 17% for Patna. Others appear not to know how to draw up budgets; Bengaluru overestimated the size of its budget by Rs 1,821 crore or 30% of its budget. \nThe report recommends a slew of immediate and medium-term reforms. Among those that Janaagraha recommends immediate action on are implementing a system to monitor and prevent plan violations, set up a Metropolitan Planning Committee, institute updated financial management systems for cities, update hiring requirements, give corporators adequate resources, make all mayoral terms five years and implement an effective complaint management system. \n\"The fact that Municipal commissioners do not report to the mayor but to the relevant state government department, and the lack of powers of the mayor and councillors or corporators reflect the failure of the three-tier system of governance, Anil Nair, deputy head - advocacy and reforms at Janaagraha, said. \"In addition, it isn't money alone that makes a city run well; Mumbai is a perfect example of having the resources and capacity, but still failing to deliver an adequate quality of services. One area that cities particularly lag behind in is transparency and accountability; even basic information about cities and their budgets for example is not easily available,\" he said.",

      "text": "CK Nayudu Lifetime Achievement award winners Rajinder Goel and Padmakar Shivalkar give contrasting views on honour CK Nayudu Lifetime Achievement award winners Rajinder Goel and Padmakar Shivalkar give contrasting views on honour While Rajinder Goel was happy with the recognition, Padmakar Shivalkar said that he is beyond that age when these kind of things matter. Published:February 28, 2017 7:45 pm Sunil Gavaskar wrote two chapters in his popular 1983 book ‘Idols’ for Rajinder Goel and Padmakar Shivalkar (right). (Source: Express Archives) \nOne is happy despite the late recognition, while the other couldn’t care less – this year’s CK Nayudu Lifetime Achievement award winners Rajinder Goel and Padmakar Shivalkar held contrasting views on the coveted honour. \nBoth were left-arm spinners, domestic stalwarts, and extremely unfortunate to have played in an era when world’s best left-arm spinner Bishan Singh Bedi was competing for India. And yes the only two non Test players on whom Sunil Gavaskar wrote chapters in his popular 1983 book ‘Idols’. \nBut the similarity ends there when one interacts with the two veterans, Goel seemed happy but Shivalkar was indifferent. \n“Better late than never. Der aaye durust aaye. I am grateful to BCCI for bestowing me this honour. My contribution in Indian cricket has been acknowledged,” a happy Goel told PTI on Tuesday. \nWhen Shivalkar was asked the same question, he said: “Hope you have listened to iconic composition Main Zindagi ka saath nibhata Chala Gaya (By Jaidev). It has a line Jo Mila Usiko Muqaddar samajh liya (Whatever you get is destiny). For me, I have crossed that stage of life where these things have become trivial.” \nBoth are raconteurs and have one common story to tell. Their first match fee of Rs 5 back in late 60s and early ’70s. \n“It used to be three-day Ranji Trophy matches then. So we would get Rs 15 for 3 days in which we would also have to manage three dinners. I had a job with State Bank of India that saved me,” recollected Goel. \nThe Rs 5 per day fee is commonly referred by players of that generation as “smoking fee”. \nWhen you ask Shivalkar about his playing days and to recollect a few matches, he blandly replied: “I am not the nostalgic type. What’s there to recollect? Yes a five-for in a match between Rest of World and Cricket Club of India at Brabourne. I don’t remember the year. And that Ranji final where we got Madras (Tamil Nadu now) all out for 60.” \n“But have you seen me bowl?” hearing the answer in negative, he said: “Good, you didn’t miss much.” \nDo you go to Wankhede or BKC to watch Mumbai’s Ranji matches, it was another terse reply from Shivalkar: “No, I don’t go to the stadium to watch. Whatever comes on TV, I watch.” \nSo what’s his assessment of Ravindra Jadeja , Shivalkar said:”I saw him as a coach when he was 15 years old. He has obviously improved from the time I saw him.” \nBut Goel fondly recollected some of his good spells having bowled to the likes of Sunil Gavaskar, Gundappa Viswanath, Dilip Vengsarkar. \nBut closest he came to the Indian team selection was against Clive Lloyd’s team in Bengaluru during 1974-75 series. Bedi was suspended by BCCI and was not a part of the squad. \n“It was unfortunate that it rained in Bangalore and Tiger Pataudi decided to go with three spinners Bhagwat Chandrasekhar, Erapalli Prasanna and Srinivas Venkatraghavan. I was the 12th man. The only regret I have is that if India could play Venkat and Pras -two off-spinners, why not two left-arm spinners,” he lamented. \nDoes he bear a grudge against Bishan Bedi, Goel replied:”Absolutely not. Bishan is a great friend. I met him a few months back. He is a legend of Indian cricket and was a great bowler. He played for India, captained the nation because he deserved it. I was simply unlucky.” \nHis last match fee when he retired in 1985 was Rs 150 but he has no regrets. \n“I played cricket with all my heart and did the best I could. Yes, there wasn’t media presence which we see nowadays. That’s fantastic that Ranji performances are being recognised,” Goel said. Best of Express",

      "text": "Team of the week: Steve Smith and Tymal Mills make the cut Matt Floyd picks out his Team of the Week in world cricket By Matt Floyd Last Updated: 27/02/17 3:51pm Australia's captain Steve Smith makes the team of the week after scoring possibly his best Test century against India Who have been the standout performers in world cricket this week? Sky Sports' Matt Floyd picks our team of the week... \nIt's hard to see any weaknesses in this team. It's packed full of pace, spin, and batsmen who can adapt to all forms of the game. \nDo you agree with our team? And who was the MVP from the XI this week? Tweet us @SkyCricket ... \n1) Matt Renshaw (Australia) \nA vital 68 in tough conditions in Pune as Australia won the first Test win against India underlined Renshaw's immense promise as a Test opener. He could be a real thorn in England's side in the Ashes at the end of the year. \n2) Quinton de Kock (South Africa) - Wkt South Africa batsman Quinton de Kock has hit three half-centuries in a row in the ODI series against New Zealand \nHis good form continues with three half-centuries in a row against New Zealand. Has played a big part in South Africa's superb ODI run. \n3) Steve Smith (Australia) - Capt \nWhat a century that was from the skipper in Pune , arguably Smith's best-ever Test knock. Also, he out-captained Virat Kohli in conditions that should have favoured India heavily. \n4) AB de Villiers (South Africa) \nHe has been steady, if not spectacular, since his return as ODI captain, but he cranked things up with 85 in the third ODI in Wellington as the Proteas got back to winning ways . \n5) Ross Taylor (New Zealand) Ross Taylor of New Zealand celebrates his record-breaking 17th ODI century against South Africa \nA record-breaker in the second ODI in Christchurch , scoring his 17th century - the most by a New Zealander - and he joins a group of just six batsmen to have made hundreds against all full member teams. Is it the right decision to keep him out of New Zealand's T20 side? \n6) Liam Livingstone (England Lions) \nLivingstone's stock has risen considerably this winter after an impressive tour of Sri Lanka with the Lions. Centuries in both innings of the second unofficial Test against Sri Lanka A will have catapulted him into the thoughts of the England selectors. \n7) Mitchell Starc (Australia) \nTook the crucial first-innings wickets of Kohli and Pujara in Pune, but it was his powerful hitting that really caught the eye. He scored 91 runs across both innings, more than any Indian batsman. \n8) Steven O'Keefe (Australia) Watch highlights from day three of the first Test, as Steve O'Keefe took six wickets to spin Australia to a win over India. \nThe surprise package of the week after the left-arm spinner demolished India with match figures of 12-70. Bowled with near perfect pace and accuracy, evoking memories of Monty Panesar in 2012. \n9) Rashid Khan (Afghanistan) \nIn Afghanistan the average yearly salary is still only around £330, while in the IPL auction Rashid Khan was picked up by Sunrisers Hyderabad for an astonishing £480,000! A hugely talented 18-year-old leg-spinner, he celebrated by helping Afghanistan to an ODI series win over Zimbabwe and may surprise a few in India in April. \n10) Umesh Yadav (India) \nIndia may have been hammered by Australia in the first Test, but through no fault of Yadav. He has been one of the unluckiest bowlers of the winter with a few dropped catches and bad decisions, but finally got some reward for a lot of hard work, taking 6-71. \n11) Tymal Mills (England) England fast bowler Tymal Mills reflects on his big money deal with IPL side the Royal Challengers Bangalore. \nTwo years ago Mills was facing an uncertain future after being diagnosed with a congenital back problem that meant he could only play T20 cricket. Now he is the most expensive bowler in IPL history! I can't wait to see how he goes for an RCB side in need of an incisive bowler. Also See: ",

      "text": "Flipboard \nDuring his MBA at FMS Delhi, which he pursued after completing engineering in Computer Science from VIT University (Vellore), Aman Singh interned at an investment banking banking firm but realised it wasn’t to his taste. Instead, he was fascinated by drones and the technology and business challenges their makers face — an interest going back to his engineering days. \nFor eight months Aman studied drones, trying to work out the development costs of the product, which he realised were huge. “When an app crashes, you can reboot your phone, but when a drone crashes, you’ve got to start afresh,” says Aman. \nHowever, his determination and courage carried him forward and enabled him to take a step further and start R2Robotronics in Gurugram. The flagship product that has been built under the venture is DROSNAS or the “Drone Swarm Navigation System”, a cloud-powered enterprise drone swarm management platform. The launch of the product was carried out at ESRI India’s User Conference 2017 on January 19. The R2Robotronics team \nDROSNAS was built for the GIS (geographic information system) platform. Being hardware and software-independent, it is compatible with most of the drones in the market. Customising the deployment of drones \nDROSNAS enables the user to simply fly his drones around using DROSNAS’ interface and specify the points for data collection, after which the drones fly autonomously, collect data and relay it back to R2’s cloud network, where it is processed and the results are shared with the user. \nAman calls it the Android-to-drone, which enables one to use a drone with any sensor despot. The dual-AI system makes sure that even if the server loses touch with the drone for a second, the system will have no problem navigating its path. \nThis new step in drone-based GIS means the users can now deploy drones at less than 50 percent of the original cost, with a much greater efficiency and without having to worry about the software and data. Drone fleets can now go and scan an area in a much shorter time and help the user make intelligent decisions much more quickly,” says Aman (23), who has interned with with ZOHO Corp, Rolta India and Deutsche Bank (Investment Banking). \nAnirudh Tewathia and Rakesh Routhu are the other two co-founders of R2Robotronics. Anirudh (24) is a Btech in Physics from DCE (Delhi College of Engineering) and MBA from FMS Delhi. He has worked with Sapient for one year. Rakesh (37) has done M.Acc from University of Melbourne and MBA from FMS Delhi. He has worked with Fujitsu, Royal Australian Army and more. \nDrones use a computer or a SoC (system on a chip) to connect to the cloud, and R2Robotronics installs certain programmes on top of the system to ensure flight stability and management in the event of a loss of connection with the cloud. Once the drone is connected to the cloud, one can transmit and receive data from a drone with ease. \nR2 has partnered with one of the biggest GIS solutions providers – ESRI. By leveraging the latest technology in image processing and 3D visualisation , the company is now able to provide an integrated solution for drone-based GIS needs. \nSince it is a centrally monitored system, all the information about the drone fleet is available at one place. One can monitor the drones operating from anywhere in the world. This technology enables even regulatory bodies to maintain supervision over the flights that have been logged into the system. Aman stated that data can be shared while on the move with software for processing while making sure that the user doesn’t need to worry about the OEM’s compatibility with his system. \nAfter almost spending 15 months in development, we have finally moved the product out of beta. The product has tie-ups with leading application software vendors, who help us keep the system lean, via APIs, while making sure the objectives for the user are achieved easily. We have spent almost $25,000 on R&D,” says Aman. Supporting hand \nWhen R2Robotronics was struggling to raise funds, Gurugram-based Jaarvis Accelerator came to their rescue and funded their R&D with $40,000. Since everything on the electronics front was made out of India, getting the specialised UAV sensors and boards posed difficulties for the team. \nFor startups with R&D-based funding, the import duties can wreak havoc. We were spending more on duties than we would on our development team’s stipend,” says Aman. \nThe target market of DROSNAS is made up of the businesses that are looking to adopt automation in jobs that need extraordinary amounts of human effort in open area tasks, such as security surveillance , crop analysis , logistics and GIS. \nR2Robotronics has been selected as one of the top eight startups from India to participate in the 100 Open Startups in Brazil. Their revenue model is based on a one-time setup fee, for integration of a drone with the system and attachment of any sensors, and a subscription fee, for subscription to the cloud for utilising the drone navigation service of the platform. Charges will also be levied for the addition of any new sensors, for integration and support. \nR2Robotronics has a team of three people. It is actively looking for investment to expand and expedite the process of pilots and acquiring clients, both in India and abroad. UAV/Drone market set to fly higher \nAccording to 6Wresearch, India UAV/Drone Market is anticipated to reach $421 million by 2021. Mini and micro drones are being increasingly deployed in both military and law enforcement applications. Factors like terrorist activities, border security, rising defence budget and FDI, favourable government policies on import, and increased domestic manufacturing campaign for defence aircraft and military equipment are driving the growth of this market. The report also revealed that after China and Japan, India is emerging as one of the key markets for drones in Asia-Pacific region. \nThe growth opportunity in the market has much appealed to the startup fraternity in the last two to three years. To name a few players who have capitalized on the same would be Drona Aviation, a SINE IIT Bombay incubated company (focuses on aerial cinematography); Chennai-based Atoms & Bytes (sells custom-made drones, drone kits, and accessories ); Bengaluru-based Edall Systems (provides industry-oriented training of UAVs for engineering students and builds and supplies UAV components to the Defense Research and Development Organisation and National Aerospace Labs); Mumbai-based startup Airpix (offers aerial photography and video production services for city planning and disaster management); and Netra by IdeaForge , founded by a group of IIT-Bombay graduates, an unmanned aerial vehicle that was used during the Uttarakhand floods rescue operations. \nWebsite: R2Robotronics Calling all Bangalore startups!

      "text": "TOP STORIES: \nU.S. Grains, Soybeans Drift to Multiweek Lows \nCHICAGO--Grain and soybean futures sank to multiweek lows Monday as widespread selling weighed on agricultural markets. \nCorn and wheat prices slid to roughly one-month lows as traders booked profits following rallies in the grain markets at the beginning of the month, and commodity funds liquidated bullish bets on grains. Prices for corn and wheat have been drifting lower since the middle of February, as buying and short-covering in those markets slowed. Solid demand for the crops fueled optimism in the grain markets early in the month, though massive supplies of both corn and wheat in the U.S. and overseas eventually resumed pressure on the markets. \nIndia to Become Largest Buyer of Ukrainian Wheat -- Market Talk \n0655 GMT - Ukraine might emerge as the largest supplier of wheat to India this year, with imports likely to top 3 million tons, according to an industry official. India received 780,000 tons last month, says M.K. Dattaraj, managing director of Bangalore-based Krishna Flour Mills. India--the world's third's-largest producer after the EU and China--has large stockpiles. But not all of it is high-quality, necessitating imports to cater to businesses such as bakeries. Two years of dry weather and unseasonal rains hit production, prompting India to step up purchases, notes Dattaraj. (vibhuti.agarwal@wsj.com) \nSTORIES OF INTEREST: \nOil Prices Settle Higher -- Update \nCrude prices pared gains but settled higher Monday as investors continued to weigh rising U.S. crude production against high levels of compliance with OPEC's production cut agreement. \nU.S. crude futures rose 6 cents, or 0.1%, to $54.05 a barrel on the New York Mercantile Exchange. Brent, the global benchmark, fell 6 cents, or 0.1%, to $55.95 a barrel on ICE Futures Europe. \nSouth Sudan War Choking Regional Trade Routes -- Market Talk \n11:24 ET - South Sudan's conflict continues to cut off regional transport routes, disrupting trade between the oil-rich but restive nation and its neighbors. Uganda has suffered the most from the disruption, with exports to its largest trading partner in the region dropping 72% last year, Uganda's finance ministry says. Uganda's economy is expected to grow 5% in the year ending July, 0.5% lower than earlier projected, as the effects of South Sudan's devastating war spill into the wider region. It's a setback for Africa's top coffee exporter, currently in the process of diversifying its coffee-dominated exports. \"As mitigation, efforts are underway to diversify trading partners and as well as seek access to new markets through negotiating new trade agreements\" Uganda's finance ministry says. (nicholas.bariyo@wsj.com; @nicholasbariyo) \nTHE MARKETS: \nLivestock Futures End Higher as Beef Demand Picks Up \nCattle futures ended higher Monday as higher prices for beef are expected to lure packers to the market at a time when cattle are lean. \nCME Live cattle for February rose 1.3% to settle at $1.25375 a pound. \nNear-term demand for beef has picked up coming into the month of March with beef prices on the mend at $165.59 per 100 pounds. \n\"Beef demand has picked up coming into the month of March and showlists are expected to remain very manageable in the coming weeks,\" Troy Vetterkind, owner of Vetterkind Cattle Brokerage said in a note.",

      "text": "Tweet The Hindu Newspaper in India wanted to awaken every citizen, who is also a potential reader of the Newspaper, by demonstrating the two sides of the city of Bangalore like never before. One blessed by mother nature with a thousand lakes and evergreen gardens. The other cursed and torn apart by the woes of human density in a concrete jungle. And the lines are blurred between the two cities gridlocked by traffic jams, garbage dumps, potholes, pollution, vanishing lakes and worse. J Walter Thompson created the unique mobile code that was cracked for two different videos to run parallel at the same time on one interactive video platform, viewed by simply switching the orientation of your mobile phone screen, from landscape to portrait or vice versa, inviting every citizen to see the change or share and be the change that you want to see in your city. The more the interactive mobile video was shared, the cleaner the view became on which city every citizen wanted to live in. A newspaper had delivered an important wake up call to every hand held device that \"Real Change is in your hands. DIY\"",

      "text": "News » Technology » Disruption in Amazon’s cloud service ripples through internet Disruption in Amazon’s cloud service ripples through internet \nBy Jeffrey Dastin \nSAN FRANCISCO (Reuters) - Web users experienced widespread glitches on Tuesday, from news sites to government services, after Amazon.com Inc's popular cloud service that hosts their data suffered a technical disruption. \nAmazon's Simple Storage Service, or Amazon S3, had difficulty sending and receiving clients' data for more than 3-1/2 hours, according to company status reports online. \nAmazon did not disclose the cause, and some of its smaller cloud applications in North America continued to have trouble. \nThe far reach of the disruption underscored the increasing dependence of organizations on the cloud for cheap and secure data storage. Amazon Web Services (AWS) is the world's biggest cloud business. \nApple Inc on its website reported issues with its app store, music-streaming service and other products, which it later resolved. The iPhone maker did not immediately comment on the cause; however, it previously has said it uses Amazon S3 for some storage. \nNilay Patel,‏ editor in chief of tech website The Verge, said on Twitter that an article \"published without an image because our image system runs on AWS.\" Messaging startup Slack Technologies Inc said users may have had difficulty uploading files due to problems with its hosting service, according to posts on Twitter. \n\"Imagine your business not being able to run for a day. That's a big problem,\" said Gene Munster, head of research for Loup Ventures. \nThe disruption extended beyond the business world. A site for Georgetown University professors to manage course content and grade assignments, which relies on Amazon's cloud, had \"connectivity problems,\" the university's chief information officer said in a message to students and faculty, seen by Reuters. \nA spokesperson for the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission said in a statement, \"Our cloud services provider has informed us that they are experiencing issues that are affecting page loads on http://sec.gov and that they are working to resolve the issues as quickly as possible.\" \nLoup Ventures' Munster called the disruption \"a temporary black eye\" for Amazon. Customers would not go through the hassle of switching to a competing cloud service because of a one-time event, he said. \nAWS is a large, fast-growing source of revenue for Amazon. It has helped transform the retailer, once known simply for selling books online, into a technology platform. \nAmazon shares closed down less than 1 percent. \n(Additional reporting by Subrat Patnaik in Bangalore, Stephen Nellis in San Fansisco and John Walcott in Washington; Editing by David Gregorio and Cynthia Osterman)",

      "title": "FUCKING MY SEXY BABHI",
      "text": "FUCKING MY SEXY BABHI\n 1 SEXU BABHI IN FROCK\nI am Anil 28 yrs fair looks medium built but a good length cock and a very active for sex, those days I used to stay with my brother in bangalore where I was doing my studies and a part time job. the couple had 3 children of which one was of 2 years. their house was small but cozy. my brothers wife name was Shubha and was 33 yrs of age she was whitish in complexion and had a slim figure of 34-28-34 with an average height of 5.6.in the beginning we had a very healthy relation, I used to call her bhabi and she used to call me anil .days passed by I started teaching her children tuition during my free time. for which she was very happy with me and she was a strict lady and her children and even her hubby was afraid of her she used to scold her hubby in front of me also. they had three small rooms and a attached bathroom. I was in the habit of masturbating daily but I did not enjoy doing it in there toilet as it was attached and the door also had several holes thus I used to go my friends room and used to do it there.\nWe used to have dinner together but sometimes her hubby could not as he had duties on shift basis. after dinner we used to watch TV till midnight where her children used to sleep in the same room and we used to the 2 person watching TV. more days rolled by. once her husband told me to sleep in their drawing room alone so that I can have nice sleep and they can also enjoy. I was happy on getting the room though it was small with only one window in it. a cot fit for a person was given to me the cot was made of jute with small holes .I mean the typical cot u will find in villages. I pulled on the mosquito net and lied down.\nNext day I came from my job along with some porn text and a sex magazine with nude pictures of ebony ladies and gals with some stories in it. after dinner I went to my room pulled up my mosquito net and lied on my stomach and started reading the text to which my cock responded easily it was hard and waiting to get my beating but I did not touch it I took of my clothes and was rubbing the cotton mattress with my cock and was moving my hips in circular motion. In the mean time I turned to page 4 which I still remember and found a slim lady of whitish complexion and wow she was looking like my shubha bhabi a small sound came out from my mouth and was really excited to see this as my bhabi face came in my mind I was really hot I murmured her name and pressed my hips so that my cock can get more pleasure I thought I am a stupid by not enjoying my bhabi. any way I kissed on the nude pictures sometimes on the breast, ass and cunt. all of a sudden I removed the mattress and pushed my cock in one of the hole of the jute made cot but the jute was hard and I felt pain on my cock to which I stood up opened the cup board to see a piece of soft cloth as I was searching for one I found my bhabis pink colored panty I was really happy I picked it and smelled it and my cock also smelt and oozed out pre cum. I spread an old news paper below the whole of the cot so as not to make the floor dirty. I climbed on the bed and wrapped the small panty around my cock and placed inside the jute made cot hole. husss what a feeling it was the same feeling as if you have entered a virgin cunt hole. I lied down not making more moves as I wanted to enjoy this for a longer time. I kept on reading the stories and lastly I got hooked to an incest story in which a guy was fucking his bhabi and this made me more horny I started fantasizing my bhabi and the guy as my self. I began kissing the sexy pictures and started rubbing cock in the hole and wowowooo, finally shot the best masturbating cum of my life on the paper below the cot and believe me I cummed for 30 seconds and the first 10 seconds cum made sound like as if water was tapping on the floor from a tap. I was drenched with my body sweat I got up folded the paper kept below the mattress to throw it away next morning and folded the panty and kept it back. so friends please try this type of masturbation also I am sure you will enjoy this.\nNext morning my bhabi came with tea and sat on the chair I thanked her and we sipped the tea silently all the while I was staring at her body and was thinking how will she look like when she will be in my bed but I told you she was a strict lady and she may slap me if I dare to make any wrong moves. so I thought to get more closer to her, be her close friend and seduce her. I took bath and came out with only a towel on my waist I went to the kitchen and asked for mustard oil from her she looked at my fair colored body and hairy chest she gasped as she saw me in this state for the first time. I pretended not to look at her. I applied oil on my body and dressed up had break fast and asked shubha bhabi do u like chocolates to which she says yes devar ji I like them too much .\nI came out kicked my bike and moved to my duty.\nWhile coming back I bought two 5 star chocolates after reaching her house I handed her the chocolates to her but at the same time her small elder son cam and snatched it a ran away. I felt sorry fro her and she said koi baat nahin ab hamari umar kahan hai. I told next time I will hand it to her when no one is around and I excused from her went to nearby shop again bought chocolates, came back and gave it to her while she was in the kitchen she smiled and said oh tum bhi naa is ski kiya jarurat thi.she gave one to her child and ate the other. she prepared tea for me and we sat down to have tea chatting about several subjects it was a hot evening and she was wearing a nightie and I think she was not wearing any bra I was peeping inside her clothes and suddenly she saw me and she stood up and went to the kitchen. by then her hubby also came we had dinner saw TV and I retired to my room to masturbate and sleep like last night but that night I placed her pink bra near the sex text books and masturbated and slept off. I used to hide the porn text on the slab of there store room and used to cover them with old clothes.\nOne night I found that one of the porn text was not t the same place where I had kept to which I though may be bhabi had found them and was afraid as she may scold me. but nothing happened next day I bought a small cake and handed it to her she said, tum bhi naa itna expense karne ki kiya jarrorat hai.i said u are my good friend to which she smiled and went to her room. while watching TV I asked her bahbi why dont u wear sarees to which she replied aise hi garmi hai naa, lekin kal se pehanungi. next evening when I reached home she was in a black saree and a sleeveless blouse to which I complimented her that she is looking damn beautiful she smiled and said tumhre bhai sahib to kabhi kuch nahin bolte tum to bekar main tariff kar rahe ho. I smiled and went to my room took bath and she came with tea and said han abb thik hai naa tumne saree main dekh liya hai abb main maxie pehanungi. I said thank you for listening me. she said koi baat nahin hai aur kuch hai to bolna. she was also getting frank with me but I had to proceed slowly so as to fuck her ass and cunt. she started to sit with me without covering her breast and when her husband was around she used to cover them.\nAs we got more closer my desire was getting uncontrollable one night I spoiled her black panty and kept it back in her cupboard to see her response. next morning she went to bathroom and I saw the same spoiled black panty in her hand I was excited and at the same time frightened also. after 15 mins she came out dressed in salwar kurta and looked at me smiled but did not say a word. I went in the bathroom masturbated by applying soap on my cock cleaned it and came back. I used to be the last person to leave the house in the morning. now I started to stand near her so that I could rub her ass. but did not succeed. once she said anil tum lunch karne ghar aa jaya karoo kyon ki office nazdik hai aur main bhi boar ho jati hun. I said jaroor aunga.in the office I waited for the lunch time and rushed home at 1.3pm.shubha bhabi was waiting for me dressed in saree and her breast were not covered by her pallu. she closed the door and stood in front of the mirror to comb her hair. I stood behind her and said bhabi close your eyes I have something for you she smiled, closed her eyes and said yes I know chocolates? I said no you are wrong! I placed my palms of both hands on her eyes and said please do not open your eyes and take out the thing from my pants pocket. she said thik hai jara dhere see ankh dabaoo dards ho raha hai. in the mean time I moved a bit further and touched her ass with my cock! Wow what a feeling my heart began beating faster she calm and I could she her smile on the mirror. she moved her hand back word to search for my pocket and in doing so her fingers brushed the tip of my cock. uff kahan hai pocket I guided her hand to my side pocket and she took out the packet but in the mean time I had rubbed her enough with my cock and she was also pretending as nothing had happened. I released my grip from her eyes she opened the packet and was blushed to see a black panty ad a bra. she said lagta hai tumko pata hai ki tumhari bhabi ko kiya pasand hai.maine kaha kyon nahin bhabi aapki old black panty kharab ho chuki hai and smiled to which she said han mujhe sab pata hai par chalo koi baat nahin agee se khyal rakhna and looked down at my tool which was making tent inside.again I went near her and said bhabi aapko achha laga ya nahin to wo bolin han achha laga par agee se maat lana mujhe ye sab achha nahin lagta hai. I placed my hands on her waist and said why you dont like it and pressed my cock on her ass and suddenly she pushed me back with her ass and went away with a smile. I was happy than ever to touch her ass and went to the toilet and took out my dripping cock and believe me I moved my hands only three times on my cock and I erupted like a hose pipe. wow I was getting better orgasm day after day. Then we had lunch I took a nap and went away.\nIn the evening I was sitting on the chair and she was lying on the bed next to me on her stomach she was dressed in a petticoat and a blouse and she lifted her legs which made her legs nude till her knees I fixed my eyes on them she smiled I told her u have smooth legs and she replied u have hairy and white legs and kept on watching the TV I got up and sat on the bed near her legs where my back was touching her legs I was so much involved with her that my cock responded very fast. I kept my hands on her legs as if unknowingly to which she responded and stood up and went away. After 5 minutes she came back and stood in front of the TV wow I saw her slim back I was dying to touch her and have sex with her but I could not gather the courage to ask her. anway her hubby came she changed to salwar kurta and we had dinner then they slept off but I was in no mood to sleep. I got up from the bed and peeked in her room where she was fully nude and was riding her hubbys cock which was hard but not as long as me she was riding hard I thought may be she is thinking of me while having sex she got down and lay down on the bed and behold the sight for the first time I saw her stark naked and ohh my she had shaven off her pubic hairs, she pulled him on her and crossed gripped his back with her long legs and in the mean time I had taken out my cock and was pressing it within her hubby dismounted her and she was abusing him for doing it so fast and she wore her petticoat and they slept off I shagged my cum on their door and came to my bed and masturbated in her name two more times and slept off.\nI woke up late in the morning to see all had gone and bhabi was in her bed I asked her what happened to which she said she is having headache I went to kitchen and served her tea and a tablet she thanked me and said you get ready she will prepare break fast but I said no bhabi I will take a leave today as you are unwell. she said thik hai tum naha loo phir main nahaungi. I took bath and came out with a towel on my waist and I wore my half pant but without a under wear as I thought I will seduce her today any means and have sex with her. after she took bath she wore a petticoat and a sleeveless blouse and told me it is hot today then I told her bhabi why dont u wear your daughters school skirt (her elder daughter was in class eight).she said kiya baat kartee ho skirt fit kahan hogi then I said aap mini skirt samajh kar pehan lo na please she said abb tum bolte ho to main try karti hun she went in the other room and came out wearing a skirt and the blouse I stood up and said bhabi you look very sexy in this she said kiya phir bolna I was scared and kept quite and then she burst in laughter. I smiled and sat on the sofa beside her I was looking and her sexy legs she knew about my looks but did not say any thing.\nI could not gather the courage to propose her. hours went by and by 2 pm it was time for children to come back she said main skirt change karti hun nahin to I said nahin to kiya bhabi??? She said chup badmas budhu .I smiled went to my room she came behind me and said anil turn around as she needs to change her skirt and I was surprised to hear that she wanna change her dress in my presence. I was happy as she was getting too close to me, after she changed she said turn around and saw her in pink saree again I gave her compliments and pinched her cheeks to start off she said ouch kiya kar rahee ho bachee anee walee hain maine kaha sorry and went behind her and grabbed her hips with my hands and pulled her towards me she pushed me back to the wall but I didnt leave her hips, she was trying to escape from my grip but I was stronger then her, in the mean time this made my cock hard and was pushing on her ass. she said anil leave me ye kiya matlab hai badtameez to which I said bhabi I am in love with you and I am helpless and kissed her neck from behind. she said to jaa kar muth kyon nahin marte ho mere panty main to mar hi chuke ho to abb usi main mara karo to santi mil jayegi. I was stunned to hear this but I said bhabi us chiz main maja nahin ata hai to wo boli to randi bajar main jaoo par mujhe chor do. I said bhabi you are there in my dreams you are so beautiful and sexy. wo boli kiya main sundar hun. I said haan bhabi ji. she said achha leave me bachee aanee walen hain par han unke samne kuch bola to ghar se bahar nikla dungi aur han sex main to nahi karoongi par main tumhara muth mar dungi aur woo bhi half pant ke upar see. I said thank you, par kab. she said after lunch children will sleep then she will do it.\nWow I was so happy. we took lunch and after the children slept for the noon sleep shubha came to my room and said han aab stand up I stood near her and touched her hands she put her hands on my cock which was fully erect she was shocked by the touch and said hmmmm kafi tagra maal hai, kiya kabhi sex kiya hai ya nahin. she was so open with me now as if we had been sex partners. I said no bhaibi nahin kiya. I closed my eyes and she shagged my cock on top the half pant for 10 minutes but I didnt cum as I know the art of controlling my orgasm. she was panting and said anil kiya baat bahut der ho gaya hai aur abhi kuch nahin hua.i said bhaibi if you take it out from the half pant then it will rain off.she smiled and unzipped my half pant and wow I was doubly excited from her hand touch she gazed at my cock and said areee admi ka hai ya ghore ka.i pulled my shirt up and my half pant was on the floor.as I about to cum I said bhabi ji dhere se hilaoo aur lama hilaoo and she did she was looking at my cock and I kept my right hand on her waist and gripped her and said bhabi u ph here I cum, and I shot my wad at least 2 meters away. she kept on pumping me and there was a look of sex in her eyes she was also squirming as she had also reached her orgasm(which she told me latter).the last drops landed on her wrist and said areee itne jor see dekho saab gandda kar diya.i said I am sorry. she went to the bath room to clean her self and in the mean time I wiped the floor dry.\nShe said oh main saaf kar detii tum bhi naa. she said anil kisi ko mat batana. I assured her went out side to smoke. my cock was a happy man now as my dream woman had touched her but I was dying now to fuck her and I was still afraid to ask for sex. any ways a week passed by where I did not ask her to repeat again as I was trying to seduce her but after 2 week also when I did not see any step from her side then I finally decided that next day I will stay on a leave and will ask her for sex and if she refuses then I will force her to do.\nThe next morning I woke up to find out that no one was at home except shubha bhabi and me. she brought tea and asked me the reason for the leave I smiled back and said I wanna you to masturbate me again, on hearing this she shouted at me and said bad tameez do not ask for this again and if you dare to then I will ask you to ;leave my house. then I said bhabi aap ne hi aag lagai hai why did you masturbated me that day and had you refused that time then I would not have dared to ask again and let me tell you if you dont listen to me then I will tell your husband and on hearing this she started weeping. oops I felt bad about it and said sorry and I told her I will leave her house in a week to a rented house. she said ok and went to the kitchen and my good ness she was wearing a black petticoat and a bra. I was able to see her whitish and slim waist my cock responded so fast that I thought of masturbating. any way I went to freshen up and started wearing my clothes and bhabi asked me why are you getting ready to which I replied I want to go to my duty and I am sorry for my behavior and she smiled and said it is ok I can understand your desire but I am sorry. I took my break fast and as I was about to step out it started raining heavily outside to which bhabi said anil come back and stay at home, I said bhabi I will get bored so it is better I go. she smiled and said ok I will not let you get bored. I said ok and changed my clothes to a half pant without any undies. I went to kitchen where she was making tea she smiled and said kiya baat hai garmi lag rahi hai I said han bhabhi ji, she said main tumhari garmi nikal deti hun. then I said what you mean. she said I repeat the incident again, par bhabi abhi to aap mana kar rahi thi to wo boli han par I am feeling pity for you. I stood behind her and gripped her waist and pressed my cock on her ass by now it was hard she felt it and gasped ..uuu leave me do not cross your limits. I left her and went to my room to wait for her.\nAfter 10 minutes she same with luke warm oil in her a bowl and said I will massage your tool with oil today and you will enjoy this and will never ask for this. I said you are so nice. she said take off your clothes and came back after closing the door and knelt on the bed beside me to give me a hand job. I kept a big pillow under my head so that I can see her job. my cock was rock hard she gripped my cock with her red nail polished fingers and said bhaiya kitna garam hai and mota bhi hai your wife will enjoy having sex with you. I smiled and closed my eyes.\nShe started applying oil all over my cock and in a moment it was so slippery that any thing will slide on top of it. after 5 minutes pre cum started coming out and she said bhaiya do not shoot like that day or else the bed sheet will get dirty. I told her not to worry and she bent her face close to my cock to see it closely and all of a sudden I placed my hand on the back of her head and pushed it down on my cock and my cock touched her cheeks she said what are you doing I said bhabi please taste it I am dying for it she tried to resist but I managed to push my cock in her mouth she started gagging and sound like ummp,umm umm were coming from her mouth. she finally managed to take it out and was about to scold me but I pulled her on top of me and started smooching her and not giving her chance to speak I pushed my tongue in her mouth after some resistance she started sucking my tongue at the same time I was caressing her ass on top her petticoat and said bhabi give your devar a chance to serve to which she smiled and said oh yes please go ahead I was on my peak of happiness on hearing this. I said thank you bhabi ji and peeled her clothes of and we stood on the bed my cock touching her shapely thighs and leaving a trail of pre cum on her thighs she had closed her eyes due to pleasure I knelt down and kissed her shaved cunt lips I pushed my tongue in her hole and fingered her clit and loo she cummed in my mouth in 5 minutes she was panting and said bus anil ho gaya I said bhabi please one more chance I also want to cum. she smiled and lay on the bed I mounted her and she gripped my cock and placed on her hole and said anil do it slowly as you have a big one I said do not worry and gave a power full thrust to which she shouted against the heavy rain pouring out side.. aa mar diyaaaa. oo kitna lamba hai . w . u . I pulled it back and started fucking her hard she was so tight that the nerves of my cock felt all the nerves of her hole. I said bhabi I love you why did you not let me fuck you before you are so tight and she said I also wanted to fuck you before but ohh jor see han jorr see she said please do not cum inside me I said do not worry and kept on fucking her. after 2 minutes she whimpered and said anil main jahrne wali hun joorr s oh phar diy . where were you before she clinched me like a vice and reached her orgasm. and now was my chance I lay on her motion less as my cock felt the pulsations of her cunt lips I pulled it out and gave a power full and final thrust and my I bit her shoulders and cummed in her cunt she tried to push me off during the first three strong drops but after that she pulled me again and clinched me and cummed again. we lay for 5 minutes and she said wow anol I really enjoyed your cum in side my cunt it was so hot and thick and I love you as you made me reach my orgasm three times .she kissed me and said thank you.\nI got up and went to bath room and came back and was not able to look in her eyes.\n[",

      "text": "--> Tue, 28 Feb 2017-09:31pm , Pune , PTI Mitchell Starc dismissed Virat Kohli in the first innings for a duck and it was a rare failure for the Indian captain who has struck four double hundreds in as many series. \nAustralian pacer Mitchell Starc said his team is wary of a strong comeback by Indian skipper Virat Kohli, whose early dismissals were a major factor in the visitors' opening Test triumph in Pune.\nKohli could only manage scores of 0 and 13 in his two innings in the Pune Test where India plunged to a humiliating 333-run loss, their first against Australia at home in almost 13 years. Starc dismissed him in the first innings for a duck and it was a rare failure for the Indian captain who has struck four double hundreds in as many series.\n\"He's a class player, we all know that. He's scored a mountain of runs already this year. We're going to have to be wary of that Virat comeback,\" Starc told reporters in Pune.\n\"We know Kohli is going to be another key wicket for the rest of the series. There's six more times we've got to get him out to really cement this series,\" he added.\nBefore seeing the back of Kohli, Starc had dismissed Cheteshwar Pujara to start India's downfall but he said Kohli's wicket is the most prized one for him.\n\"We know he'll come back bigger and stronger, but he's one I'll take over Pujara at the moment,\" Starc, who also shared the dressing room with Kohli as his Royal Challengers Bangalore teammate, said. \"We are really happy that it happened that way for us, but we know that one Test is not going to win us the series. It's three important Test matches to go.\"\nIndia will lock horns with Australia in the second Test in Bangalore, starting March 4.",

      "text": "Feb 28 • FEATURE BOTTOM , NEWS & VIEWS • No Comments on NEWS OF THE WEIRD \nU-S-A! U-S-A! Although discouraging the marriage of children in developing nations has been U.S. foreign policy for years, a data-collecting watchdog group in America disclosed in February that 27 U.S. states have no minimum marriage ages and estimates that an average of almost 25,000 children age 15 and under are permitted to marry every year (“estimates” because some states do not keep records by age). Child marriage is often allowed in the U.S. if parents approve, although no such exemption is made in foreign policy, largely to curb developing nations’ “family honor” marriages — which often wreck girls’ chances for self-actualizing. (However, “family honor” is still, in some states, the basis for allowing U.S. child marriages, such as with “shotgun” weddings.) \nCompelling Explanations Creative: (1) Glenn Schloeffel, vice president of the Central Bucks school board in a Philadelphia suburb, recommended that science books be viewed skeptically on “climate change” because teenage “depression” rates have been increasing. Surely, he said, one factor depressing students is reading all that alarming climate-change data. (2) Seattle’s Real Estate Services rental agency has informed the family of the late Dennis Hanel that it would not return Hanel’s security deposit following his January death because Hanel had not given the lease-required “notice” giving up his apartment. (He had cancer, but died of a heart attack. Washington state law requires only that the landlord provide an explanation why it is keeping the deposit.) \nRunaway Math (1) John Haskew, who told investigators that he was “self-taught on the banking industry,” evidently thought he might succeed making bogus wire transfers to himself from a large (unidentified) national bank, in the amount of $7 billion. He pleaded guilty in February in Lakeland, Florida. (He said he thought he “deserved” the money.) (2) Katherine Kempson, 49, deciding to pay “cash” for a $1.2 million home, forged (according to York County, Pennsylvania, deputies) a “proof of funds” letter from the Members 1st credit union. Home sales are, of course, highly regulated formalities, and several attempted “closings” were halted when her money kept not showing up. One deputy told a reporter, “I’m guessing that she probably didn’t think it through.” \nThe highest bail amount ever ordered in America — $4 billion for murder suspect Antonio Willis — was briefly in play in Killeen, Texas, in February, set by Bell County’s elected Justice of the Peace Claudia Brown. Bail was reduced 10 days later to $150,000 by a district court judge, prompting Brown to acknowledge that she set the “$4 billion” to call attention to Texas’ lack of bail standards, which especially punishes indigent arrestees with little hope of raising even modest amounts when accused of minor crimes. \nWait, What? Researchers including Rice University biochemist John Olson revealed in a February journal article that one reason a man avoided anemia even though he had a gene mutation that weakened his hemoglobin was because he has been a tobacco smoker — that the carbon monoxide from smoke had been therapeutic. His daughter, with the same gene mutation, did develop anemia since she never smoked (although Olson suggested other ways besides smoking to strengthen hemoglobin, such as by massive vitamin C). \nSeveral death-penalty states continue to be frustrated by whether their lethal-injection “cocktails” make death so painful as to be unconstitutionally “cruel,” and Arizona’s latest “solution,” announced as a Department of Corrections protocol, is for the condemned to supply their own (presumably less unpleasant) drugs. (There was immediate objection, noting that such drugs might only be available by black market — and questioning whether the government can legally force someone to kill himself.) \nPeople With Underdeveloped Consciences (1) Just before Christmas, Tammy Strickland, 38, was arrested in Polk County, Florida, and charged with stealing 100 toys from a Toys for Tots collection box. (2) In February, thieves unbolted and stole a PlayStation from the children’s cancer ward at Wellington Hospital in New Zealand. (3) Judith Permar, 56, who was found dead, stuck in a clothing donation drop-off box in Mount Carmel, Pennsylvania, in February (a result, police said, of trying to “steal” items), had driven to the box in her Hummer. \nRecent Alarming Headlines “America’s Top Fortune Cookie Writer Is Quitting Because of Writer’s Block” (Time magazine, 2-3-2017). “Vaginal Pain Helps Exonerate Man Accused of Murder” (Miami Herald, 2-8-2017) (emergency medical technicians treating his sister corroborated his alibi). “Dresden Protest Against Anti-Islam Pegida Group Banned Over Snowball Fight Fears” (The Independent (London), 1-24-2017) (previously in Dresden, Germany, religious-freedom demonstrators chose “tossing snowballs” as appropriate for ridiculing Pegida). \nPhallic News From Overseas (1) Earlier, He Would Have Been Worshipped: In February, doctors at Narayana Health City in Bangalore, India, were successful in a five-hour, 20-specialist surgery normalizing an infant born with the chromosomal abnormality “polymelia” — which resulted in four legs and two penises. Doctors praised the parents, from rural Puladinni village, for recognizing the issue as “medical” and not as “superstition.” (2) In February, police in southern Bangladesh arrested a family that used a fake penis to convince neighbors that the family had the powers of genies (“djinns”). The villagers had known the family had a girl, but overnight the genies had “changed” her into a “boy,” thus frightening the villagers into making offerings to the family. \nUndignified Deaths (1) Unhappy Ending: Clifford Jones, 58, was killed in a one-vehicle crash in Detroit in January, having lost control of his car because, according to Michigan State Police, he was distracted by watching pornography on his cellphone. He was also not wearing pants. (2) Leslie Ray Charping, 75, of Galveston, Texas, lived “much longer than he deserved,” according to his daughter, in a widely shared obituary in February, in a life that “served no obvious purpose.” The death notice referenced his “bad parenting” and “being generally offensive,” and closed with “Leslie’s passing proves that evil does in fact die.” \nLeast Competent Criminals Willie Anthony, 20, and Jamarqua Davis, 16, were arrested in Kannapolis, North Carolina, in February after, police said, they broke into a Rent-a-Center at 2 a.m. and stole a big-screen TV. After loading the set into one car, they drove off in separate vehicles, but in their haste, smashed into each other in the parking lot. Both men subsequently drove the wrong way down South Cannon Boulevard, and both then accidentally crashed separately into other vehicles, allowing police to catch up",

      "text": "We are not competing with other apps but rather enabling them to collaborate cloud: Prysm Amit Jain, President & CEO, Prysm, Inc. \nIn an exclusive interaction with Dataquest, Amit Jain, President and CEO of Prysm, Inc., divulged on how the collaboration solutions provider is enhancing its offerings with Prysm Visual Workplace and its plans to move ahead in India. Amit Jain, President & CEO, Prysm, Inc. \nHow is Prysm positioning itself? When there is competition in the collaboration space especially in the traditional line of solutions. In what ways Prysm is different from them and what value does Prysm bring to the customers? When we look at the term collaboration, it is a widely used word. If one is doing video conferencing; doing a phone call, using a chat tool, working together on a whiteboard, sharing an email or doing a WebEx, then collaboration is happening. Even using a Dropbox is also collaboration. There are hundreds of companies out there which are doing collaboration in one way or the other. \nWe at Prysm believe in the concept of Visual Workplace. Anything we do, the experience moves along from meeting rooms to huddle rooms, a laptop to mobile phones and tablets. We provide a standardized experience across the board by offering a platform that allows you to do all of this, from video conferencing to content sharing on the same platform. The most important feature of our solution is that everybody can simultaneously add, edit, remove and annotate the content without passing out controls to each other. \nOur solution allows one to freely interact, edit content and walk away, the data gets automatically stored and one can start where he or she left off. Also, Prysm is an agnostic platform, it is compatible with all hardware systems. So, all the investment that a client has already made, be it for video conferencing from Cisco or Polycom, our software works with it. Prysm brings all of this together which is not the case with anyone else. \nYou started some 10 years ago. Was the visual workplace concept in place ever since the inception? The visual workplace is relatively a new concept. The first invention we came up with, was a display technology called the Laser Phosphor Display. With this, our focus was to create a video wall of any size, any resolution with any brightness level. 10 years ago, we had sensed that LCD will move on from 40 inches, 80 inches and 90 inches size. We ensured a breakthrough in this space and began offering screens from 100 inches and above. Now we offer display screens ranging from 100 inches to 200 inches with 100 feet and more. \nSo, this led to an inception of Visual Workplace in 2014 and since then, our solution has been agnostic in nature where the client can buy display screens from us or can also integrate with its own devices. \nHow true is that how true is that your solution is not to replace any other product in the market but to enable them? In what context are you taking it to the customers? One of the major challenges that many enterprises have faced is that they already have deployed existing collaboration technologies. In addition, there is a lot of information and data that needs to be managed through advanced collaboration solutions. To cater to them, we have announced integration with existing technologies. For example we have launched integration with Microsoft OneDrive for Business and Office 365, making it easier for our clients to work with Microsoft Corp. tools and applications. With this integration, enterprises are not only able to leverage their existing Microsoft investments but remain confident that their shared data is safe, secure and accessible where one left it. \nIn the current enterprise market, we are witnessing the entry of a number of apps in the collaboration space. What is your take on that? We truly are witnessing so many new entrants and announcements happening every day. For instance, apps like Slack have really gained popularity in enterprise space, Cisco has come up with Spark and Microsoft is also experimenting a lot of features in the collaboration space. Similarly, DropBox, Microsoft One Drive, and Google Drive are also offering multiple and huge cloud storage options. No one is thinking about collaborating these solutions with visual content & applications. We at Prysm have gone beyond the usual, we are not competing with them rather enabling them to collaborate cloud with not just content but also applications, visuals, and chat features etc. We are connecting with all. \nHow do you see the organization evolve in India? Are you planning to enhance your reach and gain more customers in the near future? The IT environment in India is getting adapted quickly to ever changing technologies. In this conducive environment, the industry is witnessing productivity, new applications, use cases and it has become easy for an enterprise to start with a certain number of licenses. \nFor us, the focus has been enterprise customers who are multinationals in India or large Indian companies who have a base globally. Majorly our operations are based out of Bangalore and we are expanding in a significant way through sales and hiring. We also have a dedicated team in Delhi-NCR (Gurgaon) and Mumbai for upcoming demo centers in these cities. We are also looking at some other satellite cities. \nAdditionally, we are also planning to enter the mid-sized company’s market and focusing on how we can assist the government operations in India. In the US, we are already providing our solutions for government projects. For an instance, NASA has extensively deployed our solutions, also top 5 government institutions are using our solutions. \nAs you mentioned channel partners, have you signed any channel partners to take you further. We have signed with a couple of channel partners in India and globally. Most of the fulfillment is done through channel partners, but we also have some direct customers. Recently, we signed with WWT, $8 billion dollar Channel Company and one of the largest channel partners in our business. We are also working with some other premium channel partners like AVI-SPL, Impianti, Pentatel, Polymedia, Smart AV and Yorktel. \nIs there any direct competition to Prysm right now? Our direct competition is the legacy. For an instance, when we entered display solutions segment, our competition was projectors, LCDs. We have been known for replacing legacy solutions.",

      "text": "\n The Parish Priest of St.Patrick's Catholic Church in Bangalore in India during a Sunday Mass, made an Ironical statement. He said to CHRISTIAN that the best way to behave as a CHRISTIAN during this 40days lenten period is to take LOTS of BEER.\n\n\nLol, You don't have to be Scared or Perplexed; He didn't actually mean what you are thinking in your heart right now.  Below is actually what he meant:\n\n B-BIBLE: Read your Bible.This is God's given time, you are expected to be spiritually enriched with the word of God.\n\n E-EMPATHY: Feel empathy for the poor, less Privileged, Motherless, the Fatherless, the Maniac, the disable and neglected. Take good care of them and Show Constant Love to them.\n\nE-EUCHARIST: Go for mass frequently besides Sunday's.If possible everyday. Take in the Body of Christ Daily.\n\nR-RECONCILIATION: This is the best time to reconcile with those we have hurt, disappointed in the past, those we are in Malice with. Seek forgiveness and make Peace. Restore our relationship with God and one another.\n\n\nHave a wonderful and joyful Lent and do not forget your BEER.\n\nHappy New Month From MY NEWS VILLA EDITORS!!

      "text": "Kashmir Life   The aftermath of Burhan’s killing left families divided across Kashmir. There was no way one could have reached their loved ones studying outside Valley. To ease the pain a group of volunteers offered the much needed help, both emotional and monetarily. Aakash Hassan reports the group’s good, bad and ugly experiences On July 8, after the news of Burhan Wani’s death became public, the first causality was communication. Except Government of India run BSNL, no other mobile network worked in Kashmir. Instantly, life was thrown out of gear, with people struggling to reach their loved ones, residing in and outside Kashmir valley. Shakir Hussain Bhat, 25, a young businessman settled in Rohtak Haryana, couldn’t control his emotions when he talked to his parents after a long pause. “They too broke down over phone,” recalls Shakir. Immediately Shakir made his mind to set a line of communication for people like him. Same day, Shakir posted on his Facebook, ‘if someone is from my area post a message here for your family’. After the message was posted Shakir would contact his friends in Kashmir, who had BSNL phones, and tell them pass the message to the family. “I released that most of the messages were from students studying outside, asking for money from their parents in Kashmir,” recalls Shakir. “I came across a number of messages where students managed their expenses by selling their belongings.” Shakir, a struggler himself, who started his business at very young age as a shawl vendor, turned nostalgic and decided to help. “I wrote an email to Greater Kashmir newspaper and asked people to contact me if they need any immediate financial help,” recalls Shakir. Once the message was published on the newspapers website, Shakir received hundreds of emails and calls. There were all kinds of requests: students outside requested him for monentarily assistance while locals asked him to help pay their bills. Shakir went on without refusing any request and begun paying bills and transferring money. “I didn’t sleep for first couple of days due to the quantum of calls I received,” he recalls. After a few days, Shakir got a call from likeminded group, who too wanted to help people in need. “Within no time the number of people offering help grew,” recalls Shakir. The new faces in team were: Owais Qasim Mir, a Qazigund resident who was pursuing BDS from a Lucknow university; Mohammad Rafiq, a Soura Srinagar resident, who is a junior scientist in Chennai; Dibesh Pandita, from Pulwama, who studies at Ambala university; Shah Tawfeek, data scientist in Bangalore; Inam-ul-Haq and Muzaffar Ahmad, PHD scholars at Gujrat university; Dr Imtiyaz and Dr Zahoor, both living in Indore and a few others. Spread across Indian cities these youngsters kept in touch with each other through a Whatsapp group. “Their aim was common. So we started working together, like a team,” said Shakir. As they began working together, they shared their individual experiences of helping the unknown. “As the stories began to unfold we spotted a problem,” recalls Shakir. There were a number of individuals who had sought help from more than one person. “We realized that there were people who were taking advantage of our help,” said Shakir. So, in order to avoid confusion, Shakir and his friends began asking for ID proofs from individuals who sought help. As the requests heaped, they created a facebook page to manage the rush. “We were working round the clock from our respective locations,” said Shakir who took time off from his business to devote himself to project help. With a number of students in the group now, it was easy to understand and relate with their issues, like payment of dues and rent. “I was caught in the same situation and left cashless,” said Owais. “Initially I sold some of my belongings and managed myself.” But to help his friends and other Kashmiri students studying in Lucknow, Owais sold his bike and AC. On the other hand, Mohammad Rafiq used his scholarship amount to help Kashmiris students. “We got calls from Kashmiries who worked in foreign counties and India. They extended whatever help they could,” said Shakir. “We connected donors directly to the needy. It helped us save our time.” Once the situation worsened back home, and Kashmiris became target of fanatic mobs in Indian cities, Shakir offered his place in Rohtak to the students who left their college in fear. “We left our college in fear and contacted Shakir on facebook. He welcomed us to his house,” said a Kashmiri student who studies in Haryana. When Rafia, a postgraduate student at a Punjab college, was asked to pay her exam fee within five days, she had no option but to seek help. On a friends advice Rafia contacted one of the group members and shared her problem with him. “I literally wept on phone while talking to him,” recalls Rafia, who refused to give her full name. The same day money was transferred in Rafia’s account, saving a precious year of her studies. But not all requests received by the group were meaningful; some of them left Shakir and his friends angry too. One such call came from Kashmir where a person asked Shakir to recharge his dishTV connection immediately. “When I refused on the grounds that there are people who lack basic needs, the guy started abusing,” recalls Shakir. On another occasion a girl called and asked for money as she wanted to go on a trip. “We are not millionaires. We were using our lifetime savings to help people,” said Mohammad Rafiq. But despite the occasional letdowns the group continued with their noble work. “We collectively managed more than Rs 5 lakh,” said Shakir. “Most of the beneficiaries were students.” Once the money would reach the needy, they would thank Shakir and his friends and assure them that once the system is restored in valley, they would pay back. However, once the communication was restored in Kashmir, only thirty percent of the money was retuned. Ironically, as the requests continued to reach, the group tried to contact people they had helped earlier, hoping they will payback so that more people could be helped. “But nobody bothered to respond. Even some started abusing us, and would deny receiving anything at all,” said Shakir. As the response from people left a bad taste among volunteers, a number of them left the group in disgust. “I sold my belongings to help people. But when I contacted them after the situation improved, their behavior broke my heart,” recalls Owais. “A girl had given number of her father and when I contacted that number, it was her boyfriend, who threatened me with FIR, if I contacted again,” said Shakir. “I gave around Rs 3 lakh to people during peak crisis, but only Rs 1 lakh and a few thousands were returned.” If things would have worked smoothly as Shakir thought initially, there were plans of applying for a permanent toll free helpline number. “I was also planning to open an account in the name of the group. The idea was to create a permanent trouble shooter for students studying outside,” said Shakir. But as the group was duped by most of the people, the plan was dropped, said Shakir. “I will not stop helping in future, but the response is certainly discouraging,” said Mohammad Rafiq. Though the facebook page is still functional but the group is dejected and hurt. “I helped not for reward, but to serve my people who genuinely suffered,” said Shakir “Our lord will reward us.”",

      "text": "Global payments firm Payoneer reveals triple-digit Asia volume growth every year since 2012 Saheli Roy Choudhury Tweet Share Asia's burgeoning e-commerce industry has seen many payments companies race to invest in customers' appetite for digital transactions by offering differentiated services, sealing mergers and acquisitions and spending top dollar on marketing. Payoneer, a payments processing company based in New York, steered toward a more niche market by targeting small businesses selling globally. That strategy has seen the company register triple-digit growth in payment volume in Asia since 2012, according to data seen by CNBC. Globally, the company's payment transaction volume in 2016 grew 86.2 percent to $7.82 billion, whereas Asia saw a massive 153 percent increase on-year. \"There is a huge opportunity to empower small businesses, wherever they are in the world, to be able to pay and get paid,\" Patrick de Courcy, head of Asia Pacific at Payoneer, told CNBC. Payoneer has three segments of focus in Asia — cross-border payments for businesses that sell on global marketplaces like Alibaba and Lazada; vacation rentals on platforms like China's Tujia; and digital freelancers. The company works by processing customer payments on a marketplace and then doling out the money to sellers. Payoneer has introduced new payment services in Japan and China, where international businesses can sell into these markets and collect funds in local currencies with ease. Payoneer belongs to a relatively smaller group of companies that focus more on the business-to-business side of the massive payments sector. Direct interactions with consumers are often limited. Its competitors include Bluesnap, PayU and Dutch company Adyen. Earlier this month, Adyen, which counts the likes of Netflix, Facebook and Uber as clients, announced it processed $90 billion in transactions in 2016. As Asia's largest e-commerce market, China is a target for most companies doing business in the region. But competition from domestic players is stiff in China. De Courcy says Payoneer's strategy there is to build partnerships with companies throughout the e-commerce ecosystem — including manufacturers, sellers, logistics and providers of other auxiliary services. There's growing interest in China among small businesses outside of the country, according to de Courcy. He said that interest led Payoneer to set up the local currency payment option in China. Payoneer now has offices in Tokyo, Shanghai, Shenzhen, Manila, Bangalore, Seoul and Hong Kong and is says it is looking to set up more offices around the region. Globally, it has raised $234 million in funding and de Courcy said there are no current plans for an initial public offering. Reblog",

      "text": "India on notice after serving up 'poor' pitch Ben Horne, The Daily Telegraph | 1st Mar 2017 8:10 AM Australia's captain Steve Smith bats during the third day of the first Test match in Pune Rajanish Kakade   \nFURTHER merit has been added to Steve Smith's hundred in Pune after the ICC officially reported the Pune pitch as unacceptable. \nIndia has been put on notice for the \"poor\" condition of the wicket and the BCCI is now under intense pressure not to prepare another rank turner for the rest of this series. \nIt's an embarrassing turn of events for the BCCI, who have not only been exposed for their pitch doctoring ways, but have copped a taste of their own medicine. \nIndia's attempts to order a turning pitch in Pune backfired spectacularly, with Virat Kohli and their batsmen becoming victims of the BCCI's own attempts to control conditions and undermine their opposition. \n\nAll eyes will be on the Bangalore wicket for the second Test, which will be unveiled to both teams later today. \nThe ICC last night announced that match referee Chris Broad had lodged a rating of \"poor\" for the Maharashtra Cricket Association Stadium in Pune, expressing concern over the quality of the pitch. \nIndian officials now have 14 days to respond to the notice, but a heavy fine is likely. \nAustralian captain Smith was shocked when he first caught sight of the Pune wicket and his fears were reinforced by commentators led by Shane Warne who labelled the surface as resembling an \"eighth-day\" pitch. \nNow the ICC has officially confirmed Smith's fears. \n\nBut despite the almost unplayable nature of the surface, Smith managed to score an 18th Test hundred which effectively sealed the match for Australia. \nSmith's second innings ton outscored the two totals Indian batsmen were able to put together in the match. \nAustralia are preparing for a much flatter pitch in Bangalore which is expected to favour India because spinners Nathan Lyon and Steve O'Keefe will be forced to work even harder for their wickets. \nHowever, reverse swing is expected to become a major factor bringing Australian pacemen Mitchell Starc, Josh Hazlewood and Mitchell Marsh into the game.",

      "text": "A Gallimaufry of my academic and creative writing - fiction, short stories, articles, musings, book reviews, technology, management, philosophy, self help, food, travel, health, inspirational and academic writing Tuesday, February 28, 2017 Room 406 – a Geek, a Nerd, a Dork, and Flirty Banter ROOM 406 a GEEK a NERD a DORK and and FLIRTY BANTER Fiction Short Story – A Romance By It is late and the bar at the Savoy in Mussoorie is almost empty. There are just three people in the bar. A couple, a man and a woman – probably in their thirties – sit together on a sofa. And on the couch just behind them sits a solitary man – unseen – in the shadows – drinking quietly . It is quite dark as the lights are dim. In fact the lights are so dim that the man and the woman can hardly see each other’s face. They have been drinking for quite some time. The woman appears pleasantly drunk as she engages the man in some light-hearted banter. She slurs loudly as she speaks. “She dumped you, isn’t it?” the woman says to the man, her drinking companion. “No. That’s not true. Leena did not dump me. It was I who left her...” the man says emphatically. “Come on, Anil. Do you think I don’t know everything about you two?” “You don’t. You know nothing. It was I who left her. I told you once – and I am telling you again! Leena did not dump me. I dumped her. I did not want to live with Leena – so I left her. Yes – it was I who dumped Leena.” “Don’t fib...!” “Fib...? Why should I fib...?” “Masculine pride...!” “Masculine pride...? What nonsense...!” “When a man ditches a woman she gains sympathy – but when a woman dumps a man he becomes a laughing stock, a subject of ridicule.” “So?” “That’s why you ran away from Bangalore after spreading false stories all around that you were the one who had split up with her – when actually it was Leena who had dumped you unceremoniously,” the woman jeers loudly. “Talk softly,” the man says. “Why? You are afraid of the truth, is it?” “I told you it is not true. We had our differences. And I wanted a change of job.” “Anil – do you know why Leena dumped you? Because you are a bloody ‘loser’. A born loser!” “Who told you that?” “She did. I will never forget what Leena told me about you. Anil – do you want to hear Leena’s exact words? Listen carefully to what she said about you: ‘ Anil is a born loser who is content to wallow in the gutter and see others climb mountains ’ . That’s why she left you. Leena was very ambitious. She wanted to go places – she wanted to have the best things in life. She did not want to ruin her life with you – she thought you are a man with no future – a namby-pamby who has no ambition, no drive. Leena told me that you were a namby-pamby good-for-nothing geek.” “Namby-pamby? Good-for-nothing geek? She called me that?” “That’s what she told me.” “She told you? When? Where?” “Last year. In Pune. During this same annual IT Seminar. She had flown down to Pune from the America. She even presented a paper – I’m sure it was plagiarized from something you had written – or from the notes you kept giving her about your work and research.” “I am not interested!” “Leena is real smart – a real scheming bitch. She mesmerizes you with her wily charms – uses you to get ahead – and then jettisons you – just throws you away when she’s got what she’s wanted. Like toilet paper! ” “You are calling me ‘ Toilet Paper ’? ” “Shall I use a better metaphor than toilet paper ?” the woman starts giggling, and says, “She treated you like a bloody pad – a sanitary napkin! Use and throw – straight into the dustbin.” “Shut up, will you?” the man shouts angrily, “Let’s go now. You are drunk.” “I still remember our Bangalore days when you used to grovel at her feet – your tongue drooling like a lapdog. And now look where she’s reached – she is the hot shot CEO of a top IT company while you wallow in your self-made misery as a ‘ Nobody ’ in some nondescript place.” “Please, Nanda! Let’s go,” the man says, exasperated. But the woman is in no mood to go – so she ignores him – and she continues talking loudly, “Leena is smart! She told me she’d managed to hook some NRI Head Honcho. He’s an American citizen too. Her life is made!” “Maybe, she’ll use him and dump him too!” the man says sardonically. “Hey! You have accepted it! You have accepted that she dumped you. I was right! That calls for a drink.” “No. You have already had three big bottles of beer.” “Who’s counting?” the woman says happily, lurching from her seat, “Okay. If I have had too much beer – now I’ll have whisky!” The woman picks up the man’s whisky glass – drinks the whisky ‘ bottoms up ’ in one go – and she exclaims at the top of her voice: “Cheers! Down the hatch!” “What’s wrong with you?” the man scolds her, “ Don’t you know – Beer and Whisky – it’s risky.” “Risky! And frisky! I want to feel frisky.” “You shouldn't drink so much.” “Why?” “Someone may take advantage of you!” “Ha! Maybe I want to be taken advantage of – yes – it’s been a long time since anyone took ‘advantage’ of me – come – take advantage of me,” the woman says loudly. T hen the woman snuggles up to the man, and she says to him, “Come on, Lovey-dovey. Cuddle me. Do something naughty to me – like you used to do to Leena. Remember…” “Shut up. Someone will hear!” “Come on sweetie-pie, don't be such a killjoy,” the woman says snuggling even closer, “No one will see, no one will hear. We are all alone. There is no one here!” “We are not alone,” the man whispers gravely, noticing the solitary figure in the shadows for the first time. He moves close to the woman and says softly into her ear, “Don’t look behind you.” “Where?” the woman shouts in surprise – and she turns around. The drunk woman sees the silhouette of the man – and she brazenly calls out to him, “Hey Mr. Eavesdropper! What are you doing sitting all alone? Come, why don’t you join us?” “Thanks. But it’s okay. I’m fine here,” the stranger says. “No! No! Come on. Have a drink with us. Don’t be a snob!” the woman shouts drunkenly. Then the woman tries to get up and reels towards the stranger. Seeing her swaying and lurching in an inebriated manner, the stranger quickly joins them, pulling up a chair opposite the sofa. “I hope we have not been disturbing you,” the man says to the stranger, “We’re sorry. We thought we were all alone in the bar.” “Not at all!” the stranger says, “in fact, I have been enjoying your flirty banter.” “Flirty banter? Wow! That calls for a drink!” the woman says. “Certainly. My pleasure! The drinks are on me,” the stranger says. “That’s the spirit,” the woman roars. “Nanda – p lease – I think you have had enough to drink,” the man pleads with his woman companion. “I insist,” the stranger says, “just one last drink.” “Just one last drink!” the woman repeats drunkenly, “I’ll have whisky!” The stranger orders a round of drinks. The drinks arrive. T hen the stranger silently sips his drink – he seems to be quite drunk – his eyes closed – as if in stupor. Meanwhile the flirty couple – the man and woman – Anil and Nanda – continue their flirty banter. The woman takes a gulp of whisky, and then she says to her companion, “Anil – I am going to give you a real surprise!” “Surprise?” “We’ll all go and wake up Leena!” “Leena? She’s here? In Mussoorie?” “Yes, my dear. Leena is coming for the seminar too. She must have arrived in the evening when we had gone out for our romantic walk to Lal Tibba.” “How do you know?” “I was the one who called her for this seminar,” the woman says. “What? You did not tell me!” the man says, totally surprised. “Of course not! And by the way – I have not told Leena that you would be here for the seminar. I am just waiting to see the fireworks when you two meet.” “I’m going back!” the man says. “You still desperately love her, don’t you? After all that she has done to you – Leena destroyed your life, your career – and you still love her . ” “No. I am not in love with Leena.” “ You’re still scared of her, aren’t you? Tell me Anil – you are still scared of Leena, aren’t you? ” “No. I am not scared of Leena.” “Then why are you afraid of facing her? Come on, Anil, be a man! Ask her why she dumped you so unceremoniously. Leena owes you a bloody explanation, doesn’t she?” The woman pulls the man’s hand and she lurches, “Come. We’ll go to the reception and find out in which room Leena is staying.” The stranger – who has been sitting silent all this while – suddenly speaks. “Leena is in Room 406...” the stranger says wryly. “Room 406...? How do you know?” the woman asks – wide-eyed – trying to focus on the stranger. “I am Leena’s husband,” the stranger says, matter-of-factly. Then the stranger keeps his glass on the table – and he silently walks out of the bar.   1.

      "text": "I had straightening at Green Trends, Hopes College branch, Coimbatore on Jan 26th and I informed that I have a complementary hair wash on Jan 29th. When I went for the complimentary hair wash, my stylist told me that there is a bend in the backside, so we'll have to do correction again. She informed me that there was only a single bend. Then, I took hair bath after 2 days and was able to acknowledge that my hair has completely turned to its previous state. It was looking like I have not had a straightening at all.\nI am an IT professional working in Bangalore. I took leave and came to Coimbatore for the hair correction since the hair must be left free for 2 days after correction.\nI had the hair correction on Feb 24th. After my first hair bath on 26th Feb, I was able to see bends on my hair again. It's not looking like straightened hair. Only the lower part of my hair is straight.\nThe stylist told that one month gap is essential to do correction. But that was false. Most of my friends and hair care websites said that the straightened hair should not be heated again for any reason atleast for 3 months. The stylist did not tell this to me.\nAgain I visited the salon by Feb 26th evening and showed them my hair. I did not get proper response. They told me to come on the next day (27th Feb). I went on the next day too. There was a trainer who checked my hair. His name is Suresh. I said all the happenings from beginning to him. He checked my hair. He told me to wait for a few mins. I guess he has a call with some higher management person. Then, he had a discussion with the stylist (Meena) who did me straightening. Finally, they told me that they will provide 2 complimentary spa services and again correct my hair. I disagreed and told them I have no trust and to refund my money. The manager of Coimbatore branch too spoke to me via telephone. He too said the same. He told that we will do everything as complimentary. I asked him what is the assurance you give me and how can I trust that the same will not repeat again. He replied that he can do only this and refund is not possible. He also told me that the complimentary services that they provide further will be by a trainer who is well trained. Why did they not do this first?\nI feel that the money as well as my time is total waste. Why are they having people with no experience? Am I the one to experiment with??? I deeply regret choosing your salon for my straightening. It was not like this before. I had my first straightening at green trends on September, 2015. It was an excellent experience then. It's not so now. I will never suggest this salon to anyone after this.\nI have attached the copy of my bill. Take necessary action. I can't be patient further. I can't waste my time again on your complimentary services. I want my money back.",

      "text": "India vs Australia: How good are hosts' batsmen against spin? Pune Test busted the myth Rajesh Tiwary Feb, 28 2017 08:37:11 IST #Australia #Australia in india 2017 #Cricket #Dean elgar #India #Kevin pietersen #Michael clarke #Monty panesar #Nathan lyon #Pitch #Pune #Rangana herath #Shane warne #Sports #Steve o'keefe #Steven smith \nTeam India’s cheerleading squad, also sometimes referred to as television commentators are often heard gushing about Indian batsmen’s ability to play spin. Oh, the spinners have never troubled us much they would say, recounting an anecdote or two about Shane Warne getting rendered ineffective on these shores. \nThe plural of anecdote is not data though. A closer look at the numbers would show that while our batsmen have mostly been better than the touring teams, the dominance against spin is far from what we were used to seeing in the 1990s. Australia's Steve O'Keefe celebrates getting Virat Kohli's wicket in the 2nd innings of Pune Test. AP \nThe current team has enjoyed a season of unprecedented home dominance over the past two years. While Indian batsmen have made merry on flatter surfaces, the numbers are far from flattering whenever they have played on rank turners like the ones at Mohali and Nagpur in 2015 against South Africa and at Pune against Australia in 2017 with scores of 201, 200, 215, 173, 105 and 107. \nIt’s easy to dismiss batting against spin on some of these minefields as a game of Russian Roulette where you just ride your luck, but as touring batsmen like Steve Smith and Kevin Pietersen have demonstrated, there are methods to improve your odds of success. \nCricket stats analysis engine, Cricviz showed that Australians played and missed 50 times in their second innings and 44 in their first, a number substantially higher than an average inning of the same duration. While an ignorant observer will view this as lady luck smiling on the tourists, a nuanced view will show that this was part of a practised plan. Australian batsmen played and missed at 50 balls in their innings! #INDvAUS \n— The Cricket Prof. (@CricProf) February 25, 2017 \nWhile Kevin Pietersen had planned to get rid of the close-in fielders by attacking the spinners, Smith, in his own words, eliminated one-half of the bat by playing the line and not the turn. The idea is to rule out certain modes of dismissal and finding percentage shots to score your runs. \nSmith was also happy to go down the pitch not only as a run-scoring option but also to disturb spinners’ lengths and could go back to defend whenever the length was even slightly short. As Damien Martyn showed in 2004, a strong back foot game against spin can bring you success on these pitches. \nOver the years, we have seen a pattern where Indian batsmen have struggled against left-arm spinners, especially of the quickish variety. Australia discovered it in Mumbai in 2004 when Indian batsmen were able to negotiate Nathan Hauritz comfortably, but Michael Clarke who hadn’t bowled at all in the match took six wickets for nine runs in a spell of six overs to skittle India in their second innings. Monty Panesar was the chief architect of India’s defeat in 2012 against England and Steve O'Keefe surprised many including himself with astonishing returns in Pune. Even a part-timer like Dean Elgar seemed more effective with his left arm spin at Mohali in 2015 than specialist South African spinners, Simon Harmer and Imran Tahir. At Galle in 2015, India surrendered to Rangana Herath, getting all out for 112 in the fourth innings. \nVarious explanations have been given for this apparent decline in India’s ability to play spin. A modern Indian batsman doesn’t have the same kind of exposure to quality spin on turning pitches at the first class level as the batsmen of yore. Once famous for running down the pitch at the slightest invitation against spin to open several scoring options, they now try to lunge back and forward from the crease. \nIn 2000, when Indian batsmen were struggling against Nicky Boje’s left arm spin on a fourth-inning pitch at Bangalore, Mohammad Azharuddin showed the way with a classy hundred. In one of his interviews, he demonstrated how he can defend with a closed face to negate the chance of nicking it to slip. \nOn a turning pitch, a left arm spinner or a leg spinner would generally try to pitch it within the line of the stumps. While MCC coaching manual would teach you to try and play with the spin as much as possible, if you can reach to the pitch of anything that is pitched on leg or middle, a wristy punch can open up the whole leg side. Think of VVS Laxman against Warne. Of course, it takes years of practice to develop the skill before you can do it against a high-quality international spinner and it requires really nimble feet when the bowlers are not giving it much air on a pitch that is turning square. \nIndia may do themselves a favour by not preparing any more pitches that resemble Pune or Nagpur. As the England series proved, Ashwin and Jadeja have enough guile to deceive batsmen even on a good batting wicket and their batsmen can use the friendly conditions to score big and score quickly to give them enough time to dismiss the opposition twice.",

      "text": "7 Indian-American students nominated for Truman scholarship Posted on 2/03/2017 by Dailyexcelsior HOUSTON, Mar 2: Seven Indian-American students have been nominated for the prestigious Harry S Truman Scholarship, which is given to college juniors for demonstrating leadership potential and a commitment to public service. The students will compete for the prestigious national awards, which provides up to USD 30,000 for graduate study. The awards are given to college students on their records of leadership, public service and academic achievement. Only about 60 Truman Scholars are named nationwide each year. The foundation reviewed 768 potential scholars from 315 institutions before settling on the 199 students from 136 institutions, according to a release. Among the scholarship finalists were Shreya Ganeshan of the University of Georgia, Anjali Misra of the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, Samarth Gupta of Harvard University, Megan Patel of Georgetown University, Maya Durvasula of Duke University, Manju Bangalore of the University of Oregon, and Anjana Murali of the University of Pittsburgh. A foundation regional review panel will interview the finalists from March 3-April 7, with the scholars being announced April 21. The Truman Scholarship Foundation was established by Congress in 1975 as the federal memorial to President Harry S Truman. Each year, a selection committee reviews applications from more than 600 nominees for the Truman Foundation in Washington. (AGENCIES) Share this:",

      "title": "Pune wicket was not poor, says India's Murali Vijay",
      "text": "AFP\nNew Delhi\nBatsman Murali Vijay on Wednesday rejected the idea that the Pune pitch was to blame for India's drubbing in the first Test against Australia despite it being classified as\"poor\"by the match referee.\nVirat Kohli's team crumbled twice for totals of 105 and 107 in the two innings at Pune's Maharashtra Cricket Association Stadium, going down to less fancied Australia by 333 runs.\nThe nature of the Pune track, which turned sharply from day one, prompted the International Cricket Council (ICC) match referee Chris Broad to express concern over the quality of the pitch.\nBut speaking ahead of the second Test which begins in Bangalore on Saturday, Vijay resisted the temptation to blame the pitch for India's meek showing in Pune which brought an end to a 19-match unbeaten run.\n\"I don't say the Pune wicket was a poor wicket. It was a challenging wicket from ball one,\"the Indian opening batsman told reporters.\n\"As cricketers we need to play on such wickets to test your ability rather than playing on flat tracks,\"said Vijay, who registered scores of 10 and 2 in his two outings in Pune.\nVijay, like many others, expected a sporting track at Bangalore's M Chinnaswamy Stadium but insisted that he is not too bothered about the character of the wicket.\n\"Personally I don't go into a match seeing the wicket. I go into the middle with an open mind and look to adapt according to the pitch conditions,\"said Vijay.\nVijay said the team was keen on addressing key issues like dropped catches which allowed Australian skipper Steve Smith four lives during the batsman's gritty century in the second innings.",

The awards are presented annually on Jefferson’s birthday, April 13 , by the president of the University and the president of the Thomas Jefferson Foundation, the independent, nonprofit organization that owns and operates his home, Monticello. April 13 is known locally as Founders Day, celebrating Jefferson and his founding of UVA in Charlottesville in 1819. \n“This year’s medalists embody Jefferson’s vision of global citizenship and his relentless dedication to human progress and innovation,” said Leslie Greene Bowman, president and CEO of the Thomas Jefferson Foundation. \nBowman and Sullivan will present the medals, struck for the occasion, to the recipients at a luncheon in in the Dome Room of the Jefferson-designed Rotunda at UVA. The medalists in Architecture, Law, Citizen Leadership and Global Innovation will each give a free public lecture at UVA, and will be honored at a formal dinner at Monticello. \nThe complete schedule of events for Founder’s Day can be found here . \nThe Citizen Leadership medalist, Alice Waters, will also be the featured keynote speaker at Monticello’s commemoration of Jefferson’s 274th birthday on April 13 at 10 a.m. on the West Lawn of Monticello.
